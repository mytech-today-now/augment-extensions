# Comedy Genre

**Category**: Screenplay Genre  
**Type**: Primary  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Comedy films prioritize humor, laughter, and entertainment through wit, physical gags, situational irony, and character-based humor. The genre emphasizes timing, surprise, and the subversion of expectations.

## Core Concept

Comedy screenplays are built around creating laughter through character flaws, misunderstandings, absurd situations, or clever wordplay. Success depends on establishing a comedic tone early, maintaining consistent logic within the absurdity, and balancing humor with genuine emotion or stakes.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Establish the Comedic Tone Immediately

**Description**: The first 5-10 pages must signal to the audience what kind of comedy this is and what to expect.

**Why It Matters**: Audiences need to calibrate their expectations. Tonal confusion kills comedy.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Opening scene demonstrates the specific type of humor (slapstick, witty banter, awkward situations)
- ❌ **Bad**: First 20 pages are serious drama, then comedy appears randomly

**Film Reference**: Airplane! (1980) - Absurdist humor established in the first minute.

---

### Rule 2: Comedy Comes from Character

**Description**: The funniest moments arise from characters behaving consistently with their established personalities, not from random jokes.

**Why It Matters**: Character-based comedy is sustainable and emotionally resonant. Random jokes feel disconnected.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Uptight character's rigid behavior creates humor in chaotic situations
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters act out of character just to deliver a punchline

**Film Reference**: The Big Lebowski (1998) - The Dude's laid-back personality creates humor in every situation.

---

### Rule 3: Rule of Three

**Description**: Comedic patterns work best in threes - setup, reinforcement, payoff/subversion.

**Why It Matters**: Two is predictable, four is repetitive. Three is the sweet spot for comedic rhythm.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character fails twice in similar ways, third attempt succeeds in unexpected manner
- ❌ **Bad**: Same joke repeated five times with no variation

**Film Reference**: Hot Fuzz (2007) - "The greater good" repeated three times for comedic effect.

---

### Rule 4: Escalate the Absurdity

**Description**: Each comedic set piece should be more outrageous than the last, while maintaining internal logic.

**Why It Matters**: Escalation maintains energy and prevents the comedy from feeling flat or repetitive.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Small lie → bigger lie to cover first lie → elaborate scheme to maintain lies → complete chaos
- ❌ **Bad**: Same level of absurdity throughout with no escalation

**Film Reference**: Liar Liar (1997) - Jim Carrey's inability to lie escalates from minor to catastrophic.

---

### Rule 5: Subvert Expectations

**Description**: Set up audience expectations, then deliver something unexpected but logical in hindsight.

**Why It Matters**: Surprise is essential to comedy. Predictable jokes aren't funny.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Setup suggests one outcome, deliver a different but equally logical outcome
- ❌ **Bad**: Telegraphed punchlines the audience sees coming

**Film Reference**: Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) - Constant subversion of medieval epic expectations.

---

### Rule 6: Ground Comedy in Truth

**Description**: Even absurd comedy should be rooted in recognizable human behavior, emotions, or situations.

**Why It Matters**: Audiences connect with truth. Grounded comedy is more relatable and sustainable.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Exaggerated version of real awkward social situations
- ❌ **Bad**: Random absurdity with no connection to reality

**Film Reference**: The Office (2005-2013) - Workplace comedy grounded in real office dynamics.

---

### Rule 7: Timing is Everything

**Description**: Comedic beats need proper setup, breathing room, and precise delivery timing on the page.

**Why It Matters**: Rushed or poorly timed jokes fall flat. White space and pacing create rhythm.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Setup... brief pause... punchline. New paragraph for reaction.
- ❌ **Bad**: Setup and punchline crammed together with no breathing room

**Film Reference**: Arrested Development (2003-2019) - Masterful comedic timing and callbacks.

---

### Rule 8: Create Comedic Conflict

**Description**: Comedy should arise from genuine conflict between characters, goals, or values.

**Why It Matters**: Conflict creates stakes and makes the comedy meaningful, not just random gags.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Two characters with opposing goals forced to work together
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters tell jokes at each other with no real conflict

**Film Reference**: The Odd Couple (1968) - Conflict between neat freak and slob drives all comedy.

---

### Rule 9: Balance Humor with Heart

**Description**: Audiences need to care about characters and outcomes, not just laugh at them.

**Why It Matters**: Pure mockery becomes mean. Emotional investment makes comedy more satisfying.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: We laugh with characters we care about, not just at them
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters are punching bags with no depth or sympathy

**Film Reference**: Groundhog Day (1993) - Bill Murray's character growth gives comedy emotional weight.

---

### Rule 10: Maintain Internal Logic

**Description**: Even in absurd comedy, the world must follow its own established rules consistently.

**Why It Matters**: Inconsistent logic feels lazy. Consistent absurdity is funnier.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: If magic exists, it follows specific rules that create comedic situations
- ❌ **Bad**: Rules change based on what's convenient for the joke

**Film Reference**: Ghostbusters (1984) - Supernatural elements follow consistent rules that enable comedy.

## Guidelines

### Structure

- **Act I**: Establish comedic tone, introduce flawed protagonist, inciting incident creates comedic situation (pages 1-25)
- **Act II**: Escalating comedic complications, character's flaws make things worse, false victory, all seems lost (pages 25-85)
- **Act III**: Final comedic set piece, character growth resolves situation, emotional payoff (pages 85-110)

### Pacing

- Joke or comedic moment every page (at minimum)
- Major comedic set piece every 10-15 pages
- Vary joke types (verbal, physical, situational, character-based)
- Allow brief emotional beats between major comedic sequences
- Build to biggest laugh in climax

### Character Archetypes

- **Protagonist**: Flawed but likable, often oblivious to their own ridiculousness
- **Straight Man**: Reacts to absurdity, grounds the comedy
- **Comic Relief**: Intentionally funny character (use sparingly in comedy - everyone should be funny)
- **Antagonist**: Often uptight, rigid, or representing what protagonist must overcome

### Tone and Atmosphere

- Consistent comedic voice throughout
- Optimistic and playful
- Self-aware without being meta (unless that's the style)
- Energetic pacing
- Subgenre-specific (slapstick vs. witty vs. dark comedy)

### Visual Style

- Physical comedy requires clear staging
- Reaction shots are crucial
- Visual gags in background
- Exaggerated but readable expressions
- Timing indicated through white space and formatting

### Dialogue

- Wit and wordplay
- Subtext and irony
- Callbacks and running gags
- Rhythm and musicality
- Character-specific speech patterns that create humor

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Jokes Without Story

**Problem**: String of unconnected gags with no narrative throughline.

**Solution**: Every joke should serve character or plot. Comedy enhances story, doesn't replace it.

**Example**: Jokes arise from character trying to achieve their goal, not random asides.

---

### Pitfall 2: Mean-Spirited Humor

**Problem**: Laughing at characters' pain without empathy or growth.

**Solution**: Make characters sympathetic. Earn the right to mock them by making them human first.

**Example**: We laugh at their mistakes because we relate, not because we're cruel.

---

### Pitfall 3: Explaining the Joke

**Problem**: Characters or narration explain why something is funny.

**Solution**: Trust the audience. If a joke needs explanation, it's not working.

**Example**: Let the situation speak for itself. Cut any line that says "That's funny because..."

---

### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Tone

**Problem**: Shifting between comedy styles or mixing comedy with drama clumsily.

**Solution**: Establish your comedic voice early and maintain it. Emotional moments should feel earned, not jarring.

**Example**: Dramedy requires careful balance - don't undercut serious moments with inappropriate jokes.

---

### Pitfall 5: Relying on References

**Problem**: Jokes depend entirely on pop culture references that will date quickly.

**Solution**: Use references sparingly. Focus on character and situation-based humor that's timeless.

**Example**: Character-based humor from Groundhog Day still works decades later; topical references from 1993 don't.
