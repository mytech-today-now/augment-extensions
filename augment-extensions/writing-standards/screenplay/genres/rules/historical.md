# Historical Genre

**Category**: Screenplay Genre  
**Type**: Primary  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Historical films are set in specific past eras and strive for period authenticity while dramatizing real or fictional events. The genre emphasizes accurate recreation of time periods, exploration of historical themes, and making the past feel immediate and relevant.

## Core Concept

Historical screenplays transport audiences to specific past eras, using period detail to create immersion while exploring timeless human themes through historical lens. Success depends on balancing authenticity with dramatic storytelling, making historical events accessible and emotionally resonant, and using the past to illuminate the present. Great historical films feel both accurate to their period and relevant to contemporary audiences.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Research Thoroughly, Dramatize Wisely

**Description**: Ground the story in historical fact, but don't let accuracy strangle drama. Find the emotional truth within historical events.

**Why It Matters**: Audiences expect authenticity, but they need compelling drama. Balance is essential.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Compress timeline or composite characters for clarity while maintaining historical spirit
- ❌ **Bad**: Invent major events that contradict known history or ignore period entirely

**Film Reference**: Lincoln (2012) - Focuses on specific period (passing 13th Amendment) with dramatic compression but historical accuracy.

---

### Rule 2: Make the Past Feel Present

**Description**: Avoid museum-piece stiffness. Characters should feel like real people, not historical figures posing.

**Why It Matters**: Emotional connection requires seeing historical figures as human, not icons.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Period-appropriate language that still feels natural and accessible
- ❌ **Bad**: Overly formal, archaic dialogue that creates distance

**Film Reference**: The Favourite (2018) - Period setting with contemporary energy and naturalistic performances.

---

### Rule 3: Use Period to Explore Themes

**Description**: The historical setting should illuminate universal themes or comment on contemporary issues, not just provide costumes.

**Why It Matters**: Historical films should have relevance beyond period recreation.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Using past events to explore timeless questions of power, justice, or humanity
- ❌ **Bad**: Period setting is arbitrary; story could happen in any era

**Film Reference**: 12 Years a Slave (2013) - Historical slavery narrative with urgent contemporary relevance.

---

### Rule 4: Authentic Details, Not Info Dumps

**Description**: Convey period through visual details, behavior, and context, not exposition or history lessons.

**Why It Matters**: Show don't tell applies to historical context. Audiences should absorb period through immersion.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Period details visible in production design, costumes, behavior
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters explaining historical context to each other for audience benefit

**Film Reference**: Barry Lyndon (1975) - Period conveyed entirely through visuals, behavior, and atmosphere.

---

### Rule 5: Respect Historical Figures

**Description**: When depicting real people, honor their complexity. Avoid hagiography or simplistic villainy.

**Why It Matters**: Real people are multidimensional. Complexity creates richer drama.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Historical figures shown with flaws, contradictions, and humanity
- ❌ **Bad**: One-dimensional heroes or villains that ignore historical complexity

**Film Reference**: The Social Network (2010) - Recent history treated with complexity and multiple perspectives.

## Guidelines

### Structure

- **Act I**: Establish period and world, introduce historical situation/conflict, protagonist's position in historical moment
- **Act II**: Historical events unfold, protagonist navigates period challenges, stakes escalate toward historical climax
- **Act III**: Resolution of historical conflict, consequences shown, epilogue often provides historical context

### Pacing

- Balance spectacle with intimate character moments
- Use historical events to create natural act breaks
- Allow time for period immersion
- Build to historically significant climax
- Epilogue can provide historical outcome

### Character Archetypes

- **Protagonist**: Historical figure or fictional character in historical events
- **Antagonist**: Historical opponent or forces of the era
- **Supporting**: Historical figures, composite characters, witnesses to history

### Tone and Atmosphere

- Varies by period and subject (epic, intimate, tragic, triumphant)
- Sense of historical weight and significance
- Period-appropriate social norms and attitudes
- Can be reverent or irreverent depending on approach
- Often elegiac or reflective

### Visual Style

- Meticulous period production design
- Authentic costumes and props
- Locations or sets that recreate period
- Cinematography that evokes period (or deliberately contrasts)
- Color palette appropriate to era and tone

### Dialogue

- Period-appropriate without being impenetrable
- Balance authenticity with accessibility
- Avoid modern slang unless deliberate choice
- Characters speak naturally within period constraints
- Subtext over exposition

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Sacrificing Drama for Accuracy

**Problem**: Letting historical fidelity make the story boring or confusing.

**Solution**: Serve the emotional truth and dramatic arc while respecting historical spirit.

**Example**: Amadeus (1984) - Takes liberties with history but captures emotional truth of Mozart's genius and Salieri's envy.

---

### Pitfall 2: Modern Attitudes in Period Setting

**Problem**: Characters with 21st-century values and perspectives in historical setting (presentism).

**Solution**: Show period attitudes authentically while allowing audience to judge from modern perspective.

**Example**: Mad Men (TV) - Shows 1960s sexism and racism without endorsing it.

---

### Pitfall 3: Overwhelming Detail

**Problem**: So much historical detail that story gets lost in period recreation.

**Solution**: Use details to support story, not replace it. Every detail should serve character or theme.

**Example**: Dunkirk (2017) - Minimal dialogue and exposition; period conveyed through action and visuals.
