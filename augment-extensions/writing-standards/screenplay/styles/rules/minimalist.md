# Minimalist Narrative Style

**Category**: Screenplay Narrative Style  
**Type**: Tonal  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Minimalist narrative strips storytelling to essential elements, using sparse dialogue, restrained action, and visual storytelling to create meaning through what's unsaid and unseen. This style emphasizes subtlety, implication, and audience interpretation over explicit exposition.

## Core Concept

Minimalist screenwriting operates on the principle that less is more. By removing excess dialogue, elaborate action, and overt emotion, the style forces audiences to engage actively, reading between lines and finding meaning in silences. The power lies in restraint, trusting audiences to infer complexity from simple, carefully chosen elements.

## Definition

A minimalist narrative uses sparse dialogue, limited exposition, restrained visual description, and deliberate pacing to tell stories through implication, subtext, and visual storytelling rather than explicit statement.

## Structural Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sparse Dialogue

**Description**: Dialogue must be minimal, with characters speaking only when necessary and saying less than they mean.

**Why It Matters**: Excessive dialogue violates minimalist aesthetic and removes interpretive space for audiences.

**Implementation**:
- Limit dialogue to essential communication
- Use silence as dramatic tool
- Favor subtext over explicit statement
- Cut any dialogue that can be shown visually

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Two characters sit in silence for 30 seconds, then one says "Okay."
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters explain their feelings and motivations explicitly

**Film Reference**: Drive (2011) - Protagonist speaks minimally, with long silences between sparse dialogue.

---

### Requirement 2: Visual Storytelling Priority

**Description**: Convey narrative information through images, actions, and visual details rather than dialogue or exposition.

**Why It Matters**: Minimalism is fundamentally visual; telling through dialogue defeats the purpose.

**Implementation**:
- Show character state through behavior
- Use objects and environments to convey information
- Rely on actor performance over dialogue
- Trust visual medium to communicate

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character's trembling hands reveal fear without dialogue
- ❌ **Bad**: Character says "I'm scared" instead of showing fear

**Film Reference**: All Is Lost (2013) - Nearly dialogue-free survival story told entirely through action.

---

### Requirement 3: Restrained Action Description

**Description**: Action lines should be concise and objective, avoiding flowery language or excessive detail.

**Why It Matters**: Minimalist writing style should extend to prose, not just dialogue.

**Implementation**:
- Use short, declarative sentences
- Avoid adverbs and adjectives
- Describe only what's visible
- Keep action lines under 3 lines per paragraph

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: "She enters. Sits. Waits."
- ❌ **Bad**: "She gracefully glides into the room, her eyes desperately searching for any sign of hope."

**Film Reference**: The Rider (2017) - Screenplay uses sparse, poetic action lines.

---

### Requirement 4: Deliberate Pacing

**Description**: Scenes should unfold slowly, allowing moments to breathe and silence to create meaning.

**Why It Matters**: Rushed pacing undermines minimalist aesthetic's contemplative nature.

**Implementation**:
- Extend scenes beyond conventional length
- Include beats of silence and stillness
- Avoid rapid cutting or frenetic energy
- Let actions complete fully before moving on

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: 5-page scene of character preparing meal in real time
- ❌ **Bad**: Rapid montage of character's daily routine

**Film Reference**: Paterson (2016) - Deliberate pacing follows daily routine in real time.

---

### Requirement 5: Emotional Restraint

**Description**: Characters should suppress or understate emotions rather than expressing them overtly.

**Why It Matters**: Minimalism finds power in what's held back, not what's displayed.

**Implementation**:
- Characters avoid emotional outbursts
- Feelings expressed through small gestures
- Avoid melodrama or heightened emotion
- Trust audiences to infer emotional depth

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character receives devastating news, pauses, then continues task
- ❌ **Bad**: Character breaks down crying and screaming

**Film Reference**: Manchester by the Sea (2016) - Protagonist suppresses grief through entire film.

---

### Requirement 6: Stripped-Down Plot

**Description**: Plot should be simple and straightforward, avoiding complex twists or elaborate storylines.

**Why It Matters**: Minimalism focuses on character and mood over plot complexity.

**Implementation**:
- Use simple, clear narrative structure
- Avoid subplots and complications
- Focus on single character journey
- Let plot emerge from character behavior

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character attempts single task over course of film
- ❌ **Bad**: Multiple plot threads, twists, and revelations

**Film Reference**: Jeanne Dielman (1975) - Three days of domestic routine with minimal plot.

## Pacing Guidelines

### Overall Rhythm

- Slow, contemplative pace throughout
- Long takes and extended scenes
- Silence and stillness as rhythmic elements
- Avoid conventional act structure acceleration

### Scene Length

- Longer scenes than conventional screenplays (5-10 pages)
- Scenes play out in real or near-real time
- Minimal cutting within scenes
- Allow actions to complete fully

### Act Structure

- **Act I**: Establish character and world through observation (30-40% of runtime)
- **Act II**: Minimal plot development, focus on routine and behavior (30-40% of runtime)
- **Act III**: Subtle shift or revelation, often ambiguous (20-30% of runtime)

### Transitions

- Simple cuts, no fancy transitions
- Long fades to black for temporal passage
- Minimal use of dissolves or wipes
- Silence between scenes

## Visual Storytelling

### Camera Work

- Static or slow-moving camera
- Long takes without cutting
- Objective, observational perspective
- Avoid showy camera movements

### Visual Motifs

- Recurring objects or images
- Natural lighting and environments
- Muted color palettes
- Emphasis on everyday details

### Action Lines

- Short, declarative sentences
- Objective description only
- Minimal emotional interpretation
- White space on page

**Example**:
```
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

She makes coffee.

Drinks it.

Looks out the window.
```

## Dialogue Approach

### Dialogue Style

- Sparse, functional communication
- Long silences between lines
- Subtext over explicit statement

### Subtext

- Everything important is unspoken
- Silence carries emotional weight
- Audiences infer meaning from context
- What's not said matters most

### Formatting

- Short dialogue blocks
- Frequent pauses and beats
- Minimal parentheticals

**Example**:
```
JOHN
Coffee?

MARY
Sure.

Long silence.

JOHN
Okay.
```

## Technical Formatting

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Boring Emptiness

**Problem**: Minimalism becomes empty rather than meaningful, with nothing beneath the surface.

**Solution**: Ensure restraint serves character and theme. Minimalism should reveal depth, not hide shallowness.

**Example**: Drive's silence reveals character's isolation and violence; it's not just quiet for quiet's sake.

---

### Pitfall 2: Pretentious Artiness

**Problem**: Minimalism feels like affectation rather than organic storytelling choice.

**Solution**: Ground minimalism in character psychology or world authenticity. Make restraint feel natural.

**Example**: The Rider's minimalism comes from authentic rural setting and non-professional actors, not artistic pretension.

---

### Pitfall 3: Unclear Storytelling

**Problem**: Removing too much dialogue makes plot or character motivations incomprehensible.

**Solution**: Ensure visual storytelling clearly communicates essential information. Test with audiences.

**Example**: All Is Lost maintains clarity despite minimal dialogue through clear visual problem-solving sequences.

---

### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Restraint

**Problem**: Mixing minimalist scenes with conventional expository dialogue breaks aesthetic.

**Solution**: Maintain consistent level of restraint throughout. Commit to minimalist approach.

**Example**: Drive maintains sparse dialogue even in scenes where conventional screenplay would add exposition.

---

### Pitfall 5: Slow Without Purpose

**Problem**: Deliberate pacing becomes tedious rather than contemplative.

**Solution**: Ensure slow scenes reveal character or build atmosphere. Cut scenes that don't serve purpose.

**Example**: Paterson's repetitive structure reveals character through small variations, not just repetition for its own sake.
