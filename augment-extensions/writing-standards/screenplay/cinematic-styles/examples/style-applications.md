# Cinematic Style Applications

This document provides practical examples of how to apply specific cinematic styles to your screenplay.

## MCU/Avengers Style Application

### When to Use
- Superhero ensemble films
- Action-adventure with emotional stakes
- Franchise/universe building
- Character-driven spectacle
- Stories about found family and sacrifice

### Key Elements to Apply

**1. Character-First Action**
Every action sequence should reveal character and advance emotional arcs.

**Example**:
```fountain
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Iron Man hovers above the chaos. His HUD flashes: PEPPER - DANGER.

TONY STARK
(to himself)
Not again. Not her.

He ignores the alien army, diving toward Stark Tower.

JARVIS (V.O.)
Sir, the team needs—

TONY STARK
I don't care. Get me to Pepper. Now.
```

**2. Quippy Dialogue with Heart**
Balance humor with genuine emotion. Jokes reveal character, not undercut stakes.

**Example**:
```fountain
INT. QUINJET - NIGHT

Steve and Tony sit in tense silence.

TONY STARK
You know, for a guy who's supposed to be
all about teamwork, you're pretty bad at it.

STEVE ROGERS
(quiet)
I'm trying to keep us together.

TONY STARK
By lying?

Beat. Steve has no answer.

TONY STARK (CONT'D)
(softer)
I get it. You wanted to protect me.
But I needed the truth more than protection.
```

**3. Ensemble Balance**
Give every character a moment to shine, even in crowded scenes.

**Example**:
```fountain
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - WAR ROOM - DAY

The team gathers around a holographic display.

TONY STARK
We hit them here, here, and here.

NATASHA
What about civilians?

STEVE ROGERS
We evacuate first. No exceptions.

THOR
I can create a barrier with lightning.

BRUCE BANNER
And I can... smash things, I guess.

Everyone looks at him.

BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D)
What? I'm working on my contributions.

Small smiles. Tension breaks.
```

## Blue Ruin Style Application

### When to Use
- Revenge thrillers
- Crime dramas with realistic violence
- Survival stories
- Anti-hero narratives
- Stories deconstructing action tropes

### Key Elements to Apply

**1. Authentic Incompetence**
Protagonist struggles with tasks that action heroes make look easy.

**Example**:
```fountain
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

Dwight tries to pick the lock with a paperclip. His hands shake.

The paperclip bends. Breaks.

He looks around. Frustrated. Desperate.

Picks up a rock. Smashes the window.

CRASH. Glass everywhere.

He freezes. Listens. Did anyone hear?

Long beat. Nothing.

He climbs through. Cuts his hand on broken glass.

Winces. Doesn't make a sound.
```

**2. Minimal Dialogue**
Show, don't tell. Let silence build tension.

**Example**:
```fountain
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Dwight examines the wound in the mirror. Deep. Bleeding.

He opens the medicine cabinet. Finds vodka. Pours it on the wound.

His face: pain. But no sound.

Threads a needle. Hands shaking. Drops it.

Picks it up. Tries again.

Finally gets it. Starts stitching.

Each stitch: wince, pause, breathe, continue.

Sloppy. Uneven. But functional.
```

**3. Realistic Violence**
Violence is messy, painful, and has lasting consequences.

**Example**:
```fountain
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dwight and Wade struggle. Both terrified.

Wade's stronger. Pushes Dwight against the counter.

Dwight grabs a knife. Swings wildly.

Misses. Wade grabs his wrist.

They crash into the table. Chairs scatter.

Dwight headbutts Wade. Wade's nose breaks. Blood everywhere.

They fall. Both scrambling for the knife.

Wade gets it. Raises it.

Dwight grabs his throat. Squeezes.

Wade can't breathe. Drops the knife.

Dwight doesn't let go. Keeps squeezing. Tears streaming.

Wade stops moving.

Dwight holds on. Ten more seconds. Twenty.

Finally lets go. Sits back. Shaking. Covered in blood.

No triumph. Just horror.
```

## Combining Styles (Advanced)

While typically you should select ONE cinematic style per project, you can occasionally blend elements:

**Example: MCU Humor + Blue Ruin Realism**
```fountain
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

Peter Parker tries to treat a gunshot wound. Fails miserably.

PETER PARKER
(to himself)
Okay, YouTube said... no, wait, that's
for a paper cut. This is... bigger.

He pours hydrogen peroxide. Screams.

PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
Why does Mr. Stark make this look so easy?!

He tries to stitch it. Needle won't go through.

PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
(crying)
I should've paid attention in health class.
```

This combines Peter's nervous rambling (MCU) with realistic incompetence (Blue Ruin).

## Tips for AI Agents

When applying a cinematic style:

1. **Read the full style guide** before writing
2. **Identify key characteristics** of the selected style
3. **Apply consistently** throughout the screenplay
4. **Don't mix styles** unless intentionally creating contrast
5. **Reference examples** from the style guide
6. **Maintain tone** appropriate to the style
7. **Respect the rules** of the cinematic universe/film being emulated
