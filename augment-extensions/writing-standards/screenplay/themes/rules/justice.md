# Justice Theme

**Category**: Screenplay Theme  
**Type**: Universal Theme  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

The justice theme explores the quest for fairness, moral balance, and accountability. It examines what justice means, whether it can be achieved through systems or requires individual action, and the cost of pursuing it.

## Core Concept

Justice in storytelling represents the human need for moral balance—the belief that wrongs should be righted and the guilty should face consequences. It explores the tension between legal justice and moral justice, the cost of pursuing fairness, and whether true justice is ever achievable.

## Thematic Statement

The theme of justice explores what fairness means, examining whether justice can be achieved through systems or requires individual action, and what price must be paid to right wrongs.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Establish a Clear Injustice

**Description**: Justice stories require a clear wrong that demands righting—a crime, betrayal, systemic oppression, or moral violation.

**Why It Matters**: Justice without injustice is meaningless. The wrong establishes what must be balanced.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Clearly establish the injustice and its victims
- **Act II**: Show the consequences of the injustice and obstacles to justice
- **Act III**: Resolve whether justice is achieved, denied, or complicated

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *12 Angry Men*, a potentially innocent man faces execution, creating clear injustice to prevent
- ❌ **Bad**: The wrong is vague or the stakes unclear

---

### Rule 2: Differentiate Legal and Moral Justice

**Description**: Legal justice (following the law) and moral justice (doing what's right) often conflict. Explore this tension.

**Why It Matters**: This conflict creates moral complexity and difficult choices.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish both legal and moral frameworks
- **Act II**: Create situations where legal and moral justice diverge
- **Act III**: Force choice between legal and moral justice

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *A Few Good Men*, legal procedure conflicts with moral truth about military justice
- ❌ **Bad**: Legal and moral justice are treated as identical

---

### Rule 3: Show the Cost of Pursuing Justice

**Description**: Justice requires sacrifice—of safety, relationships, career, or even life. The pursuit must be costly.

**Why It Matters**: Easy justice feels unearned. Cost demonstrates commitment to fairness.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish what the character risks by pursuing justice
- **Act II**: Force them to sacrifice for justice
- **Act III**: Show the ultimate cost of achieving (or failing to achieve) justice

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *Erin Brockovich*, Erin risks her job, relationships, and safety to pursue justice
- ❌ **Bad**: Justice is pursued without personal cost or risk

---

### Rule 4: Question Whether Justice Is Achievable

**Description**: The story should explore whether true justice is possible or if it's an ideal that can never be fully realized.

**Why It Matters**: This is the central philosophical question of justice themes.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish the ideal of justice
- **Act II**: Show obstacles and compromises that complicate justice
- **Act III**: Answer whether justice was achieved or if it remains elusive

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *The Dark Knight*, Batman questions whether justice is possible in a corrupt system
- ❌ **Bad**: Justice is simply achieved without questioning its possibility

---

### Rule 5: Explore Systemic vs. Individual Justice

**Description**: Justice can come through systems (courts, institutions) or individual action (vigilantism, personal accountability). Each has different implications.

**Why It Matters**: Different approaches to justice create different moral questions.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish whether justice will be pursued through systems or individually
- **Act II**: Show the limitations and strengths of that approach
- **Act III**: Resolve whether the chosen approach achieves justice

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *The Fugitive*, Kimble pursues justice outside the system when the system fails him
- ❌ **Bad**: The story doesn't explore how justice is achieved

---

### Rule 6: Show Justice's Impact on All Parties

**Description**: Justice affects not just the guilty and victims, but everyone involved. Show the broader consequences.

**Why It Matters**: Justice isn't abstract—it has real human costs and benefits.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish all parties affected by the injustice
- **Act II**: Show how the pursuit of justice impacts everyone
- **Act III**: Demonstrate the full consequences of justice achieved or denied

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *To Kill a Mockingbird*, the trial affects the entire community, not just Tom Robinson
- ❌ **Bad**: Justice only affects the immediate parties
