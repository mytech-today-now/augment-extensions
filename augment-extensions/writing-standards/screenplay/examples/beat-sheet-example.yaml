  darkNightOfTheSoul:
    page: 85
    description: "Sarah sits alone in her apartment, surrounded by Elena's case files. She's lost everything - the case, Marcus, her sense of purpose. She looks at an old photo of her mother and realizes: she's been trying to save her mother through Elena, but her mother is gone. She can't change the past."
    realization: "Sarah realizes she's been running from her own pain by trying to fix everyone else. She can't save Elena or anyone else until she confronts her own trauma and accepts that her mother's death wasn't her fault."

  breakIntoThree:
    page: 90
    description: "Sarah does something she's never done: she asks for help. She calls Marcus and admits she needs support. She starts seeing a therapist. She visits Elena in the hospital - not as a savior, but as someone who understands."
    solution: "Instead of trying to save Elena, Sarah offers her something more valuable: the truth that recovery is possible, but it has to be Elena's choice, not Sarah's mission."

  finale:
    page: 95
    description: "Sarah testifies at Elena's custody hearing. Instead of making promises she can't keep, she tells the truth: recovery is hard, relapse is part of the process, but Elena deserves the chance to fight for her daughter. Elena chooses rehab - for herself, not for Sarah. Sarah reconnects with Marcus, this time with honesty and vulnerability. She begins her own healing journey."
    climax: "Elena must choose between her ex and her daughter. Sarah must choose between her savior complex and genuine connection."
    resolution: "Elena chooses recovery (though the outcome is uncertain). Sarah chooses vulnerability and begins building real relationships. Sofia gets a chance at stability, whether with Elena or in a loving foster home."

  finalImage:
    page: 110
    description: "Sarah sits in her car outside an apartment building - but this time, Marcus is with her. She's not alone anymore. She's not watching from outside; she's part of the world. She gets out of the car and walks toward her own apartment, toward her own life."
    transformation: "The opening image showed Sarah isolated, watching life from behind glass. The final image shows her connected, participating, moving forward. She's learned that she can't save everyone, but she can save herself - and that's enough."

notes: "This beat sheet follows the Save the Cat structure while telling a character-driven story about trauma, codependency, and healing. The external plot (saving Elena) drives the internal plot (Sarah saving herself). Each beat serves both the plot and character arc."
