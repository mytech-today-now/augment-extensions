# Universal Formatting Standards

## Overview

This document defines the universal formatting standards for screenplays based on AMPAS (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) Nicholl Fellowship requirements and industry best practices.

## Font and Typography

### Required Font

- **Font Family**: Courier or Courier New
- **Font Size**: 12-point
- **Character Spacing**: Monospaced (fixed-width)
- **Line Spacing**: Single-spaced with double-spacing between elements

**Rationale**: Courier's fixed-width characters ensure consistent page-to-screen-time ratio (~1 page = 1 minute).

### DO

```fountain
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH enters, scanning the room.
```

### DON'T

```
INT. Coffee Shop - Day  ❌ (Wrong case)

Sarah enters, scanning the room.  ❌ (Wrong font: Arial, Times New Roman)
```

## Page Margins

### Standard Margins

- **Top**: 1 inch
- **Bottom**: 0.5 to 1 inch
- **Left**: 1.5 inches
- **Right**: 1 inch

### Element-Specific Indentation

- **Scene Headings**: 1.5 inches from left edge
- **Action**: 1.5 inches from left edge
- **Character Name**: 3.7 inches from left edge (centered)
- **Dialogue**: 2.5 inches from left edge
- **Parentheticals**: 3.1 inches from left edge
- **Transitions**: 6 inches from left edge (right-aligned)

## Scene Headings (Slug Lines)

### Format

```
INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY
```

### Components

1. **INT./EXT.**: Interior or Exterior
2. **LOCATION**: Specific place (ALL CAPS)
3. **TIME OF DAY**: DAY, NIGHT, MORNING, EVENING, CONTINUOUS, LATER

### Examples

```fountain
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS
```

### DO

- Use ALL CAPS for entire slug line
- Be specific with locations
- Use standard time indicators

### DON'T

- Mix case: `Int. Apartment - Night` ❌
- Be vague: `INT. SOMEWHERE - SOMETIME` ❌
- Omit time: `INT. APARTMENT` ❌

## Action Lines (Description)

### Guidelines

- **Tense**: Present tense
- **Voice**: Active voice
- **Length**: 3-4 lines maximum per paragraph
- **Focus**: Visual and auditory elements only
- **Character Introductions**: ALL CAPS on first appearance

### Examples

```fountain
SARAH, 30s, professional but tired, enters carrying a briefcase.

She sets it down. Looks around. Something's wrong.

A SHADOW moves across the wall.
```

### DO

- Write what we SEE and HEAR
- Use short, punchy paragraphs
- Introduce characters in ALL CAPS
- Use present tense: "She walks" not "She walked"

### DON'T

- Describe thoughts: "She thinks about her mother" ❌
- Write camera directions: "CLOSE-UP on her face" ❌
- Use passive voice: "The door is opened by her" ❌
- Write long paragraphs (more than 4 lines) ❌

## Dialogue

### Format

```fountain
CHARACTER NAME
Dialogue text here.
```

### With Parenthetical

```fountain
CHARACTER NAME
(whispering)
Dialogue text here.
```

### With Extension

```fountain
CHARACTER NAME (V.O.)
Dialogue text here.

CHARACTER NAME (O.S.)
Dialogue text here.
```

### Extensions

- **(V.O.)**: Voice-over (narration, internal thoughts)
- **(O.S.)**: Off-screen (character not visible but in scene)
- **(CONT'D)**: Continued (same character continues after action)
- **(PRE-LAP)**: Dialogue starts before scene transition
- **(SUBTITLE)**: Foreign language with subtitles

### DO

```fountain
SARAH
I can't believe you did this.

JOHN
(defensive)
I had no choice.

SARAH (CONT'D)
There's always a choice.
```

### DON'T

```fountain
Sarah  ❌ (Not ALL CAPS)
I can't believe you did this.

JOHN
(He's defensive)  ❌ (Parenthetical should be action, not description)
I had no choice.
```

## Fountain Markup

### Basic Syntax

```fountain
# Scene Heading
INT. LOCATION - DAY

# Action
Character does something.

# Dialogue
CHARACTER
Dialogue here.

# Transition
> FADE OUT.
```

### Character Introduction

```fountain

```

### Emphasis

```fountain
*italic*
**bold**
***bold italic***
_underline_
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use same formatting throughout
2. **Clarity**: Write visually, not literarily
3. **Economy**: Every word counts
4. **Readability**: White space is your friend
5. **Industry Standard**: Follow AMPAS guidelines

## Common Mistakes

❌ Camera directions (CLOSE-UP, PAN TO, ZOOM IN)  
❌ Editing notes (MONTAGE, INTERCUT)  
❌ Music cues (unless diegetic)  
❌ Thoughts and feelings (unless shown visually)  
❌ Passive voice  
❌ Past tense  
❌ Long action paragraphs (>4 lines)
