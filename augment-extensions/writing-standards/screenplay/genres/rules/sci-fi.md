# Science Fiction Genre

**Category**: Screenplay Genre  
**Type**: Primary  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Science fiction explores the impact of imagined scientific or technological advances on society, individuals, and humanity. The genre uses speculative concepts to examine contemporary issues through a futuristic or alternative lens.

## Core Concept

Sci-fi screenplays are built on "what if?" questions about science, technology, and their consequences. The genre requires internal consistency, plausible extrapolation from current knowledge, and exploration of how technological or scientific changes affect human nature, society, and morality. Great sci-fi uses the fantastic to illuminate the real.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Establish Clear World Rules

**Description**: Define the scientific/technological premise early and maintain internal consistency throughout.

**Why It Matters**: Audiences will accept almost any premise if the rules are clear and consistently applied. Breaking your own rules destroys credibility.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Time travel has specific rules (e.g., can't change past) that are established and followed
- ❌ **Bad**: Technology works differently each time it's convenient for the plot

**Film Reference**: Inception (2010) - Dream mechanics are clearly explained and consistently applied throughout.

---

### Rule 2: Ground the Fantastic in Human Stakes

**Description**: No matter how advanced the technology or alien the setting, the story must center on relatable human emotions and conflicts.

**Why It Matters**: Audiences connect with characters, not concepts. The sci-fi elements should serve character and theme, not overshadow them.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: AI story about what it means to be human (Ex Machina)
- ❌ **Bad**: Cool tech with no emotional or philosophical depth

**Film Reference**: Arrival (2016) - Alien contact story is fundamentally about grief, communication, and choice.

---

### Rule 3: Extrapolate, Don't Fabricate

**Description**: Base your speculative elements on real science or logical extensions of current technology.

**Why It Matters**: Plausibility enhances immersion. Even far-future tech should feel like it evolved from something recognizable.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: AI development based on current machine learning trends
- ❌ **Bad**: Magic disguised as science with no logical basis

**Film Reference**: The Martian (2015) - Survival on Mars using real science and problem-solving.

---

### Rule 4: Use Sci-Fi to Explore Ideas

**Description**: The best sci-fi uses its premise to examine philosophical, ethical, or social questions.

**Why It Matters**: Sci-fi without ideas is just spectacle. The genre's strength is making us think about ourselves and our world.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Blade Runner explores what makes us human through replicants
- ❌ **Bad**: Spaceships and lasers with no thematic depth

**Film Reference**: Gattaca (1997) - Genetic engineering as lens for examining discrimination and human potential.

---

### Rule 5: Show the Ripple Effects

**Description**: Demonstrate how your sci-fi premise affects society, culture, economics, and daily life—not just the plot.

**Why It Matters**: Believable worldbuilding requires thinking through consequences. Technology changes everything, not just one aspect of life.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Minority Report shows how pre-crime affects law, privacy, and society
- ❌ **Bad**: Revolutionary tech exists but society is otherwise unchanged

**Film Reference**: Her (2013) - AI companions affect relationships, work, and social norms throughout society.

## Guidelines

### Structure

- **Act I**: Establish the world and its rules, introduce the sci-fi premise, show how it affects the protagonist
- **Act II**: Explore implications of the premise, escalate conflicts arising from the technology/science, test the protagonist's understanding
- **Act III**: Resolve conflicts through understanding or mastery of the sci-fi element, often with thematic revelation

### Pacing

- Balance exposition with action—avoid info dumps
- Use visual storytelling to convey world details
- Introduce concepts gradually through character experience
- Allow time for philosophical exploration without stalling plot
- Build to climax that synthesizes action and ideas

### Character Archetypes

- **Protagonist**: Often scientist, explorer, or ordinary person confronting extraordinary science
- **Antagonist**: Can be human misusing technology, the technology itself, or alien force
- **Supporting**: Mentor scientist, skeptical authority, AI companion, alien ally/enemy

### Tone and Atmosphere

- Can range from optimistic (Star Trek) to dystopian (Blade Runner)
- Sense of wonder at possibilities
- Unease about consequences
- Intellectual curiosity
- Often contemplative or philosophical

### Visual Style

- Production design that feels lived-in and functional
- Technology that looks purposeful, not just decorative
- Consistent aesthetic that reflects the world's logic
- Use of scale to convey scope (vast space, tiny humans)
- Lighting and color palette that supports tone

### Dialogue

- Avoid technobabble unless necessary; keep it minimal
- Characters should understand their world—no exposition for audience benefit
- Scientific concepts explained through character conflict or discovery
- Natural integration of futuristic slang or terminology
- Balance intellectual discussion with emotional authenticity

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Exposition Overload

**Problem**: Stopping the story to explain the science or world in lengthy monologues.

**Solution**: Reveal world details through action, visual storytelling, and character experience. Trust the audience.

**Example**: Mad Max: Fury Road shows its post-apocalyptic world through action and visuals, minimal exposition.

---

### Pitfall 2: Inconsistent Rules

**Problem**: Changing how the technology or science works to serve plot convenience.

**Solution**: Establish clear limitations and stick to them. Work within your own constraints.

**Example**: Looper establishes time travel rules and mostly adheres to them, addressing paradoxes directly.

---

### Pitfall 3: Style Over Substance

**Problem**: Focusing on cool visuals and tech without exploring meaningful themes or character arcs.

**Solution**: Use the sci-fi premise to explore human questions. The tech should serve the story, not be the story.

**Example**: District 9 uses alien refugees as metaphor for apartheid and xenophobia, not just cool alien design.
