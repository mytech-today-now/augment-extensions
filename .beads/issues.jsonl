Injection Mechanism:\n   - AI agents query via 'augx show \u003cmodule\u003e' command\n   - CLI reads module files and displays content\n   - Content is injected into AI context through CLI output\n   - No automatic injection - AI must explicitly query\n\n5. Token Consumption Patterns:\n   - FULL module content loaded when queried (all rules + examples)\n   - No selective loading of individual rules\n   - Character counts tracked in module.json but not enforced at load time\n   - Extensions.json tracks linked modules but doesn't control what's loaded\n\n6. Current Limitations:\n   - All-or-nothing loading (entire module or nothing)\n   - No skill-based selective injection\n   - No CLI wrapping for external tools\n   - Token consumption scales linearly with module size\n\nKey Files:\n- cli/src/utils/module-system.ts (loadModule, discoverModules)\n- cli/src/commands/show.ts (displays module content)\n- .augment/extensions.json (tracks linked modules)\n- augment-extensions/**/module.json (module metadata)","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:38:34Z"}]}
