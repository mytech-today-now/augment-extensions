# ACT 1: SETUP

FADE IN:

EXT. FLAMETEK INDUSTRIES - DAY

> **TITLE CARD**: "FLAMETEK INDUSTRIES - EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM"

INT. FLAMETEK INDUSTRIES - EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - DAY

A sleek corporate boardroom. Long conference table with six chairs. A presentation screen behind the head of the table. Coffee service on a side table. Everyone is in business attire.

**CHARACTERS PRESENT**:
- RONALD "RON" PEMBERTON III (CEO, 60s, New England accent) - seated at head of table, half-asleep with coffee
- BRENDA HARTFORD (CMO, 50s, Mid-Atlantic corporate speak) - standing by presentation screen
- DEREK CHEN (VP Product Safety, 30s, nervous energy) - seated with stack of folders
- MAURICE LEBLANC (Head of Legal, 50s, French accent) - seated calmly
- TODD BRINKMAN (VP Engineering, 40s, Midwestern monotone) - already sweating
- JESSICA RAMIREZ (Junior Associate, 20s, Valley Girl uptalk) - seated with tablet and excessive enthusiasm

BRENDA stands at the presentation screen, clicker in hand, beaming with corporate enthusiasm. RON's head is tilted back, eyes closed. DEREK nervously shuffles papers. TODD wipes his forehead with a handkerchief. MAURICE examines his nails. JESSICA types eagerly on her tablet.

BRENDA
(overly enthusiastic)
Good morning, everyone! Thank you SO much for making time for this incredibly important strategic alignment session!

Ron's head snaps up suddenly.

RON
(confused, groggy)
Is this the refrigerator meeting?

BRENDA
(still smiling)
No sir, this is the oven meeting.

RON
(genuinely confused)
We make ovens?

BRENDA
Yes sir, for thirty-five years.

RON
(nodding slowly)
Huh. I thought we made refrigerators.

TODD
(quietly, wiping forehead)
We... we don't make refrigerators, sir.

RON
(disappointed)
Oh.
(beat)
We should look into that.

JESSICA
(typing enthusiastically)
Literally writing that down!

Derek raises his hand tentatively.

DEREK
Um, if we could get started? This is actually pretty urgent—

BRENDA
(cutting him off, still beaming)
Absolutely, Derek! Love the energy! So, as you all know, our FlameClean 3000 self-cleaning oven has been on the market for six months now, and we've received some very... passionate customer feedback!

MAURICE
(calmly, French accent)
Allegedly passionate.

DEREK
(standing up, urgent)
Brenda, we need to talk about the safety data. I've been tracking incidents and—

BRENDA
(interrupting, gesturing grandly)
And we are SO grateful for your diligence, Derek! Why don't you share those numbers with the team?

Derek clicks his remote. A slide appears showing a graph with alarming upward trend.

DEREK
(nervously)
Okay, so... in the past six months, we've had 847 reported incidents of the self-cleaning function causing... um...
(swallows hard)
...house fires.

Pause. JESSICA drops her stylus. TODD wipes his forehead more vigorously. MAURICE doesn't react. RON squints at the screen.

RON
(confused)
Is that a lot?

DEREK
(incredulous)
Yes! That's— yes, sir, that's a lot! That represents approximately 40% of all units sold!

JESSICA
(gasping)
Oh my god.

DEREK
(gaining confidence)
Exactly! Which is why I'm recommending we issue an immediate product recall and—

BRENDA
(jumping in, still positive)
Okay, okay, let's pump the brakes on the R-word, Derek!

MAURICE
(correcting)
Alleged fires, Derek. Alleged.

DEREK
(frustrated)
No, Maurice, actual fires. Confirmed fires. Documented fires with photo evidence and fire department reports!

MAURICE
(unruffled)
Allegedly confirmed.

DEREK
(exasperated)
They're not allegedly— there are literally houses that are no longer standing!

MAURICE
(thoughtfully)
Allegedly no longer standing.

JESSICA
(to Maurice, impressed)
That's literally so smart.

Ron raises his hand like a confused student.

RON
Question. What's the difference between a bug and a feature?

TODD
(technical, nervous)
Well, technically, sir, a bug is an unintended flaw in the design, whereas a feature is an intentional—

BRENDA
(interrupting, excited, moving to center stage)
EXACTLY! Thank you, Todd! And that's exactly what we need to discuss today!
(turning to face everyone)
Is this really a problem... or is this an opportunity?

DEREK
(standing, emphatic)
It's definitely a problem!

BRENDA
(pointing at Derek, then sweeping her arm dramatically)
Or... and hear me out... what if this isn't a bug...
(dramatic pause)
What if this is a FEATURE?

Beat. Everyone stares at her. JESSICA immediately starts typing.

JESSICA
(typing, muttering)
Fire equals feature... literally genius...

DEREK
(sitting down slowly, defeated)
Oh no.

TODD
(wiping forehead, quietly)
Oh boy.

MAURICE
(slight smile)
Interesting.

RON
(still confused)
Wait, what are we talking about again? The toaster?

BRENDA
(ignoring Ron, energized)
Let's workshop this, people! This is what we do! We don't see problems, we see possibilities!

Lights shift slightly as BRENDA clicks to next slide: "SELF-CLEANING OR SELF-DESTRUCT? A STRATEGIC DISCUSSION"

DEREK
(head in hands)
We're all going to jail.

MAURICE
(calmly)
Allegedly.

# ACT 2: ESCALATION

Continuing from Act 1. BRENDA is energized, pacing. DEREK looks defeated. Others are engaged.

BRENDA
(pacing, gesturing)
Think about it, people! We're not selling ovens that burn down houses—

DEREK
(muttering)
We literally are though.

BRENDA
(ignoring him, building)
We're selling ovens that create opportunities! Opportunities for home renovation! For fresh starts! For... for reimagining your living space!

JESSICA
(standing up, excited)
Oh my GOD, Brenda, that's literally brilliant! We could literally partner with home insurance companies!

DEREK
(standing, incredulous)
Are you— are you serious right now?

BRENDA
(to Jessica, ignoring Derek)
Jessica, write that down! Insurance partnerships! Contractor referral programs!

JESSICA
(typing frantically)
This is literally going to disrupt the entire home appliance industry!

DEREK
(to the room)
It's going to disrupt people's lives! People are losing their HOMES!

BRENDA
(spinning to face him)
And getting NEW homes, Derek! Better homes! Homes they actually want!

RON
(perking up)
I like new homes. I have four of them.

TODD
(quietly, to Derek)
Technically, she's not wrong about the "new homes" part...

DEREK
(to Todd, betrayed)
Todd!

TODD
(quickly backtracking, wiping forehead)
I mean, technically, she's also not right! Technically speaking. Technically.

Derek's phone buzzes. He looks at it, his face falls.

DEREK
(reading phone)
Another one. Phoenix, Arizona. Family of four displaced.

BRENDA
(immediately spinning it)
Allegedly displaced.

MAURICE
(nodding approvingly)
Très bien.

DEREK
(showing phone)
There's a photo! The house is literally a pile of ash!

MAURICE
(examining phone, unruffled)
Hmm. You know, in 1987, there was a case— *Toastmaster v. The People of New Jersey*—where a toaster was ruled not responsible for burning toast.

DEREK
(grabbing phone back)
That's completely different!

MAURICE
(philosophical)
Is it though? Is it really? Ze toaster gets hot. Ze toast burns. But who put ze bread in ze toaster? Ze user.

BRENDA
(excited)
Yes! Exactly! User error!

MAURICE
(continuing)
Ze oven gets hot. Ze house burns. But who put ze house around ze oven? Also ze user.

DEREK
(sputtering)
That's not— you can't— that's insane!

RON
(confused but engaged)
Wait, I'm lost. Are we talking about the toaster or the microwave?

EVERYONE
(various responses)
The oven!

RON
(nodding)
Right, right. The oven.
(beat)
What's an oven?

Todd raises his hand tentatively.

TODD
(nervous)
Um, if I could just explain the technical issue here—

BRENDA
(encouraging)
Yes! Todd! Give us the engineering perspective!

TODD
(standing, wiping forehead, speaking quickly)
Well, technically speaking, the self-cleaning cycle activates a pyrolytic process that elevates the internal temperature to approximately 880 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, which, technically, creates an exothermic reaction that could, theoretically, interact with combustible materials in the surrounding environment, leading to what we might call, technically speaking, a rapid oxidation event—

DEREK
(interrupting)
A FIRE! He means a FIRE!

TODD
(quickly)
Technically, yes, but—

DEREK
(to Todd)
Todd, just say it! The oven is broken! The design is flawed!

TODD
(sweating more, conflicted)
Well, I wouldn't say "broken" exactly... more like... aggressively functional?

JESSICA
(writing)
Ooh, "aggressively functional!" That's literally perfect for the marketing materials!

DEREK
(to Jessica)
Stop writing things down!

BRENDA
(moving to the presentation screen, clicking to new slide)
Okay, okay, let's look at the data from a different angle.
(slide shows pie chart)
Yes, 40% of our ovens have caused fires. But that means 60% DIDN'T!

DEREK
(standing)
That's not— that's not how safety works!

BRENDA
(pointing at chart)
That's a 60% success rate! That's a D-minus! That's passing!

DEREK
(desperate)
A D-minus is not passing! And we're not in school, we're selling APPLIANCES!

JESSICA
(helpfully)
Actually, at my college, a D-minus was literally passing.

DEREK
(to Jessica)
NOT HELPING!

BRENDA
(clicking to next slide: customer testimonials)
And look at this! Customer satisfaction is very high among survivors!

DEREK
(freezing)
I'm sorry, did you just say "survivors"?

BRENDA
(not seeing the problem)
Yes! 4.5 stars on average!

DEREK
(slowly)
Survivors. You said survivors. As in people who survived using our product.

JESSICA
(excited)
That's literally such a powerful testimonial angle! "Survivor stories!"

DEREK
(losing it)
THAT'S NOT A SELLING POINT!

Derek's phone buzzes again. And again. And again.

DEREK
(looking at phone, increasingly panicked)
Seattle. Portland. Denver. These are all from today!

BRENDA
(undeterred, clicking to next slide)
Which brings me to my next point: rebranding!

DEREK
(sitting down, head in hands)
Oh god.

BRENDA
(enthusiastic)
The problem isn't the oven. The problem is the messaging! We're calling it "self-cleaning" which sounds so... mundane!

JESSICA
(engaged)
Literally so boring!

BRENDA
What if we called it... "Thermal Reset Technology"?

MAURICE
(considering)
Hmm. Or perhaps... "Controlled Combustion Event"?

TODD
(getting into it despite himself)
"Extreme Clean Mode"?

JESSICA
(excited)
"PyroClean™"!

BRENDA
(pointing at Jessica)
Yes! I love that! PyroClean™! It sounds premium!

DEREK
(head still in hands)
It sounds like arson.

RON
(suddenly engaged)
I like the one with the fire.

EVERYONE
(turning to him)
Which one?

RON
(confused)
...yes?

BRENDA
(to the group)
See? Ron gets it! This is about perception! We don't have a product problem, we have a branding problem!

DEREK
(standing up, slamming folder on table)
NO! No, no, no! We have a SAFETY problem! People are losing their homes! Their possessions! Their sense of security!
(impassioned)
We have a moral obligation to recall this product and fix it before someone gets seriously hurt!

Powerful silence. Everyone stares at Derek. For a moment, it seems like he's gotten through to them.

RON
(after a long pause)
...are we still talking about the toaster?

Derek slowly sits back down, defeated.

TODD
(quietly, patting Derek's shoulder)
Technically... you're not wrong.

DEREK
(quietly, to himself)
We're all going to jail.

MAURICE
(calmly)
Allegedly.

BRENDA
(clapping hands together)
Great discussion, everyone! Really productive! Now let's talk rollout strategy—

Suddenly, a FIRE ALARM starts blaring. Red lights flash.

# ACT 3: RESOLUTION

Continuing from Act 2. FIRE ALARM is blaring. Red lights flashing. Everyone looks around confused.

JESSICA
(looking up)
Oh my god, is that literally a fire alarm?

TODD
(checking his phone, face going pale)
Uh... guys?

BRENDA
(annoyed by interruption)
What is it, Todd?

TODD
(reading phone)
I'm getting an alert from the test kitchen... they were, uh... they were demonstrating the self-cleaning feature for the promotional video...

DEREK
(standing up slowly)
No.

TODD
(continuing)
...and, uh, technically speaking... the kitchen is... on fire.

DEREK
(vindicated but horrified)
I TOLD YOU! I TOLD ALL OF YOU!

Everyone starts grabbing their belongings in a panic. Papers flying. Coffee spilling. Chaos.

MAURICE
(calmly gathering his briefcase)
Allegedly on fire.

DEREK
(pointing at the door where smoke is visible)
YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE, MAURICE!

MAURICE
(heading toward door)
Allegedly visible smoke.

JESSICA
(pulling out her phone, filming)
Oh my god, this is literally going viral! I'm literally live-streaming this!

BRENDA
(still in marketing mode, even while evacuating)
Jessica, good thinking! This is actually great content! Very authentic! Very relatable!

DEREK
(grabbing his folders)
RELATABLE?! A FIRE IS RELATABLE?!

BRENDA
(heading toward door, still gesturing)
User-generated crisis content! It's very on-brand!

TODD
(panicking, wiping forehead frantically)
Technically, we should probably evacuate! Technically speaking, immediately!

Everyone is moving toward the door. RON stands up slowly, calmly, as if nothing is happening. Everyone stops and turns to look at him.

RON
(calm, authoritative)
Wait.

EVERYONE
(stopping, turning)
What?!

RON
(pause, looking around at everyone)
I've heard everyone's input. I've reviewed the data.
(another pause)
And I've made my decision.

DEREK
(hopeful)
You're issuing the recall?

RON
(shaking his head)
No.

DEREK
(deflating)
Oh god.

RON
(decisive)
We're calling it a feature.

DEREK
(exploding)
WHAT?!

BRENDA
(pumping fist)
Yes! I knew it!

JESSICA
(filming, excited)
This is literally the best decision ever!

MAURICE
(nodding)
Très sage. Very wise.

TODD
(to Derek, apologetically)
Technically, he is the CEO...

DEREK
(backing toward door, gesturing at the smoke)
There is LITERALLY a fire happening RIGHT NOW because of our product!

RON
(calm, heading toward door)
Allegedly.

DEREK
(losing his mind)
YOU CAN'T "ALLEGEDLY" A FIRE THAT'S CURRENTLY BURNING!

RON
(stopping at the door, turning back)
Also, I've made another decision.

BRENDA
(eager)
Yes, sir?

RON
(matter-of-fact)
We're pivoting to refrigerators. Much safer.

BRENDA
(enthusiastic)
Brilliant! I love it!

JESSICA
(filming)
Literally so smart!

TODD
(relieved)
Oh thank god.

DEREK
(hopeful)
Wait, really? We're discontinuing the ovens?

RON
(confused)
What's a refrigerator?

Beat. Everyone stares at him.

BRENDA
(ushering him out)
We'll explain on the way out, sir!

Everyone rushes out. DEREK is last, stopping at the door to look back at the boardroom, shaking his head in disbelief.

DEREK
(to himself)
I should've been a teacher.

He exits. The alarm continues blaring. Smoke gets thicker.

Beat.

MAURICE pokes his head back in, looks around.

MAURICE
(to no one)
Allegedly.

He exits.

BLACKOUT.

FADE OUT.
