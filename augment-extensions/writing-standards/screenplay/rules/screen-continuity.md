# Screen Continuity

## Overview

Screen continuity ensures visual coherence and spatial logic in film and television. Proper continuity helps audiences understand spatial relationships, follow action, and remain immersed in the story without confusion.

## The 180-Degree Rule

### Definition
An imaginary line (axis of action) between two characters or along a line of movement. The camera should stay on one side of this line to maintain consistent screen direction.

### Purpose
- Maintains spatial relationships
- Prevents disorientation
- Keeps characters on consistent sides of frame

### Application
**Two-Person Conversation**:
- Draw imaginary line between characters
- Keep camera on one side of line
- Character A always on left, Character B always on right

**Action Sequences**:
- Establish direction of movement
- Maintain consistent left-to-right or right-to-left motion
- Crossing the line reverses apparent direction

### Breaking the 180-Degree Rule
**When Justified**:
- Show disorientation or confusion
- Dramatic reveal or reversal
- Transition between scenes/locations
- Camera movement that crosses line visibly

**How to Cross Safely**:
- Show the camera crossing the line in one continuous shot
- Use a neutral shot (directly on the line) as transition
- Cut to a new scene/location

## Eyeline Matches

### Definition
When a character looks off-screen, the next shot should show what they're looking at from an appropriate angle.

### Rules
**Height**:
- Character looking up → camera angles down at subject
- Character looking down → camera angles up at subject
- Character looking level → camera at same height

**Direction**:
- Character looks left → subject is on left side of frame
- Character looks right → subject is on right side of frame

**Distance**:
- Close eyeline → subject is near
- Distant eyeline → subject is far

### Common Mistakes
- Mismatched eyeline direction
- Incorrect height relationship
- Subject too close/far for eyeline angle

## Match Cuts

### Types

**Match on Action**:
- Cut during movement
- Action continues seamlessly across cut
- Creates smooth, invisible transition

**Example**:
```
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Sarah reaches for the door handle.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Sarah's hand turns the door handle.
```

**Graphic Match**:
- Similar shapes or compositions across cut
- Creates visual continuity
- Can show passage of time or location change

**Match on Sound**:
- Audio bridges the cut
- Sound continues while image changes
- Creates smooth transition

### Best Practices
- Cut on movement, not stillness
- Match speed and direction of action
- Maintain consistent lighting and color
- Ensure temporal logic

## Screen Direction

### Definition
The consistent direction of movement across cuts.

### Rules
**Chase Sequences**:
- Pursuer and pursued move in same direction
- Maintain left-to-right or right-to-left consistency
- Reversal indicates change in pursuit

**Travel**:
- Establish direction of journey
- Maintain consistent direction across scenes
- Reversal indicates return journey

**Looks and Glances**:
- Characters looking at each other look in opposite directions
- Maintain consistent spatial relationship

### Neutral Shots
Shots directly toward or away from camera:
- Reset screen direction
- Transition between sequences
- Establish new spatial relationships

## Continuity Errors to Avoid

### Temporal Continuity
**Script Supervision Issues**:
- Props in different positions
- Costume changes between shots
- Hair/makeup inconsistencies
- Food/drink levels changing
- Weather/lighting changes

**Prevention**:
- Detailed script notes
- Continuity photographs
- Careful shot planning
- Matching lighting setups

### Spatial Continuity
**Common Errors**:
- Characters switching positions
- Props appearing/disappearing
- Inconsistent backgrounds
- Mismatched geography

**Prevention**:
- Overhead diagrams of scenes
- Consistent camera placement
- Clear blocking rehearsals
- Reference photos

### Performance Continuity
**Issues**:
- Different line readings
- Inconsistent gestures
- Varying emotional intensity
- Changed timing

**Prevention**:
- Multiple takes for coverage
- Video playback review
- Consistent direction
- Actor awareness

## Advanced Continuity Techniques

### Cross-Cutting
**Parallel Action**:
- Maintain separate screen directions for each location
- Use consistent spatial logic within each thread
- Clear transitions between threads

### Montage
**Continuity in Montage**:
- Progression of time/action
- Consistent visual style
- Logical sequence
- Clear beginning and end

### Flashbacks/Flashforwards
**Temporal Markers**:
- Visual distinction (color, grain, aspect ratio)
- Clear transition in/out
- Maintain spatial continuity within each timeframe
- Consistent character appearance for time period

## Writing for Continuity

### Scene Headings
Be specific about locations to avoid continuity issues:
```
GOOD:
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

BAD:
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
```

### Action Lines
**Specify**:
- Character positions
- Movement directions
- Prop placement
- Spatial relationships

**Example**:
```
Sarah sits at the LEFT side of the table. John enters
from the RIGHT and sits across from her.
```

### Transitions
Use transitions to signal continuity breaks:
- CUT TO: Standard cut
- MATCH CUT TO: Match on action/graphic
- DISSOLVE TO: Time passage
- SMASH CUT TO: Abrupt change

## Category-Specific Considerations

### Film
- Strict continuity for theatrical release
- Multiple takes for coverage
- Detailed script supervision

### Television
- Faster production requires careful planning
- Multi-camera setups need special attention
- Episodic consistency across episodes

### Live TV
- Real-time continuity challenges
- Pre-planned camera positions
- Rehearsal critical

### Web Content
- Shorter scenes reduce continuity complexity
- Single-location shoots simplify continuity
- Jump cuts more acceptable

## Best Practices

### DO
✅ Plan shots with continuity in mind
✅ Use overhead diagrams for complex scenes
✅ Take continuity photos between setups
✅ Maintain detailed script notes
✅ Review footage for continuity errors
✅ Establish clear spatial relationships
✅ Use consistent screen direction

### DON'T
❌ Cross the 180-degree line without justification
❌ Mismatch eyelines
❌ Ignore prop/costume continuity
❌ Forget to establish spatial relationships
❌ Change screen direction arbitrarily
❌ Neglect temporal logic
❌ Assume continuity will "fix itself in post"
