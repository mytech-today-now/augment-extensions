FADE IN:

EXT. TOKYO SKYLINE - NIGHT

Neon lights pierce through rain. A city that never sleeps.

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the city. Minimalist. Cold.

ALEX CHEN, 35, ex-military, scars tell stories, stands at the window. Phone to ear.

ALEX
(into phone)
I'm out. Find someone else.

VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered, distorted)
You don't get to be out, Alex. Not after what you know.

Alex hangs up. Tosses the phone on a glass table.

A RED DOT appears on the window. Laser sight.

Alex DIVES as the window EXPLODES. Glass rains down.

EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

SNIPER, masked, adjusts scope. Fires again.

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Alex rolls behind a concrete pillar. Pulls a GLOCK from an ankle holster.

ALEX
(to herself)
So much for retirement.

She low-crawls to a side door. Bullets PUNCH through the walls above her.

INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Alex bursts through. Sprints toward the elevator.

The elevator doors are CLOSING. She slides through just in time.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Alex catches her breath. Checks the gun. Full magazine.

The elevator LURCHES. Stops between floors.

VOICE (V.O.)
(over speaker)
Going somewhere?

The lights CUT OUT. Emergency lighting kicks in. Red glow.

ALEX
(calm, deadly)
You made a mistake.

She PUNCHES through the ceiling panel. Pulls herself up.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Alex climbs the cable. Hand over hand. Thirty floors up.

Below, the elevator PLUMMETS. CRASHES at the bottom.

Alex doesn't look down. Keeps climbing.

She reaches a maintenance door. Kicks it open.

INT. MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Narrow. Pipes and wiring. Alex moves fast.

A FIGURE steps out ahead. Gun raised.

OPERATIVE
End of the line.

Alex doesn't slow down. Runs STRAIGHT at him.

The Operative FIRES. Alex slides under the shot. Sweeps his legs.

He goes down. Alex disarms him in one fluid motion.

ALEX
Who sent you?

OPERATIVE
(laughing)
You really don't know, do you?

Alex pistol-whips him. He's out cold.

She takes his radio. Listens.

RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
Target is in the maintenance level. All units converge.

ALEX
(into radio, mimicking)
Copy that. Moving to intercept.

She drops the radio. Crushes it under her boot.

INT. PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Alex emerges from a service door. Scans the area.

Rows of luxury cars. Empty. Too quiet.

She moves between vehicles. Reaches a BLACK MOTORCYCLE.

Hotwires it in seconds. Engine ROARS to life.

HEADLIGHTS flood the garage. Three BLACK SUVS screech in.

ALEX
(smirking)
Showtime.

She GUNS the throttle. The motorcycle LAUNCHES forward.

The SUVs give chase. Bullets RICOCHET off concrete pillars.

Alex weaves through the garage. Hits a ramp. Goes AIRBORNE.

EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

The motorcycle lands hard. Alex doesn't flinch.

She races through traffic. The SUVs follow, smashing through cars.

PEDESTRIANS scatter. Horns BLARE.

Alex spots an alley. Cuts hard right.

EXT. NARROW ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Barely wide enough for the bike. The SUVs can't follow.

Alex emerges on the other side. Slows down. Blends into traffic.

She pulls out a burner phone. Dials.

ALEX
(into phone)
It's me. I need a favor.

FADE OUT.

THE END
