# Technology Theme

**Category**: Screenplay Theme  
**Type**: Contemporary Theme  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

The technology theme explores humanity's relationship with technological advancement, examining whether technology serves or controls us, enhances or diminishes our humanity, and the unintended consequences of innovation.

## Core Concept

Technology in storytelling represents human innovation and its double-edged nature. It explores the promise of progress versus the cost of advancement, the question of whether technology makes us more or less human, and the responsibility that comes with creating powerful tools.

## Thematic Statement

The theme of technology explores whether innovation serves or controls humanity, examining the unintended consequences of advancement and what we risk losing in the pursuit of progress.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Show Technology's Promise and Peril

**Description**: Technology must be presented as both beneficial and dangerous. It offers genuine advantages while creating new problems.

**Why It Matters**: One-sided portrayals (purely good or evil) lack nuance. Technology is complex.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish what technology promises (convenience, power, connection)
- **Act II**: Reveal unintended consequences and dangers
- **Act III**: Answer whether benefits outweigh costs

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *Her*, AI offers genuine connection but raises questions about authentic relationships
- ❌ **Bad**: Technology is portrayed as purely beneficial or purely evil

---

### Rule 2: Explore the Human Cost of Technology

**Description**: Technology changes how we live, think, and relate. Show what human qualities or experiences are lost or transformed.

**Why It Matters**: This explores whether progress comes at the cost of humanity.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish human experiences before or without technology
- **Act II**: Show how technology changes these experiences
- **Act III**: Answer what was gained and lost

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *WALL-E*, technology has made humans physically helpless and disconnected from reality
- ❌ **Bad**: Technology has no effect on human experience or relationships

---

### Rule 3: Question Who Controls Whom

**Description**: Explore whether humans control technology or technology controls humans. Who serves whom?

**Why It Matters**: This is the central question of technology themes—are we masters or servants of our creations?

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Show technology as tool serving human needs
- **Act II**: Reveal ways technology controls or limits human behavior
- **Act III**: Answer who ultimately has control

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *The Matrix*, humans believe they're free but are actually controlled by machines
- ❌ **Bad**: The relationship between humans and technology is never questioned

---

### Rule 4: Explore Unintended Consequences

**Description**: Technology created for one purpose often has unforeseen effects. Show how innovation creates new problems.

**Why It Matters**: This explores the responsibility of creators and the complexity of progress.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish the intended purpose of technology
- **Act II**: Reveal unintended consequences
- **Act III**: Address responsibility for these consequences

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *Jurassic Park*, genetic technology intended to entertain creates deadly consequences
- ❌ **Bad**: Technology works exactly as intended with no unexpected effects

---

### Rule 5: Question What Makes Us Human

**Description**: Technology often blurs the line between human and machine. Explore what defines humanity.

**Why It Matters**: This examines whether humanity is defined by biology or something else.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Establish assumptions about what makes us human
- **Act II**: Use technology to challenge these assumptions
- **Act III**: Answer what truly defines humanity

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *Blade Runner*, replicants raise questions about what makes someone human
- ❌ **Bad**: The line between human and machine is never questioned

---

### Rule 6: Show the Responsibility of Creation

**Description**: Those who create technology bear responsibility for its use and consequences. Explore this moral burden.

**Why It Matters**: This addresses the ethics of innovation and progress.

**Application**:
- **Act I**: Introduce creators and their intentions
- **Act II**: Show consequences of their creations
- **Act III**: Address whether creators accept responsibility

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: In *Ex Machina*, Nathan must face the consequences of creating conscious AI
- ❌ **Bad**: Creators face no responsibility for their innovations
