# Realistic Narrative Style

**Category**: Screenplay Narrative Style  
**Type**: Tonal  
**Complexity**: Medium

## Overview

Realistic narrative prioritizes authenticity, naturalism, and verisimilitude, depicting life as it actually is rather than heightened or stylized versions. This style emphasizes everyday situations, natural dialogue, and believable character behavior grounded in observable reality.

## Core Concept

Realistic screenwriting seeks to mirror actual human experience with minimal artifice or dramatic contrivance. The power lies in finding drama within ordinary life, trusting that authentic human behavior and genuine emotion create compelling narratives without melodrama or manipulation. Success requires keen observation of real life and commitment to truth over convention.

## Definition

A realistic narrative depicts characters, situations, and dialogue that closely resemble actual human experience, avoiding melodrama, coincidence, or theatrical convention in favor of naturalistic authenticity and psychological truth.

## Structural Requirements

### Requirement 1: Naturalistic Dialogue

**Description**: Characters must speak as real people do, with hesitations, interruptions, incomplete thoughts, and everyday language.

**Why It Matters**: Theatrical or polished dialogue breaks realistic illusion and distances audiences from authentic experience.

**Implementation**:
- Use contractions, slang, and colloquialisms
- Include verbal tics, pauses, and interruptions
- Avoid perfectly articulated speeches
- Let characters talk over each other

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: "I mean, like, I don't know... it's just... you know?"
- ❌ **Bad**: "I find myself unable to articulate my precise feelings on this matter."

**Film Reference**: Before Sunrise (1995) - Naturalistic conversation flows like real people talking.

---

### Requirement 2: Believable Character Behavior

**Description**: Characters must act according to psychological truth and realistic motivation, not plot convenience.

**Why It Matters**: Contrived behavior for plot purposes destroys realistic authenticity.

**Implementation**:
- Ground actions in established character psychology
- Avoid convenient personality shifts
- Show realistic decision-making processes
- Include mistakes and poor choices

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character makes imperfect decision based on limited information and emotional state
- ❌ **Bad**: Character suddenly acts out of character to advance plot

**Film Reference**: Manchester by the Sea (2016) - Characters behave according to psychological truth, not plot needs.

---

### Requirement 3: Everyday Situations

**Description**: Focus on ordinary life situations rather than extraordinary circumstances or heightened drama.

**Why It Matters**: Realism finds drama in normal life, not manufactured crises.

**Implementation**:
- Set scenes in familiar locations (homes, workplaces, cafes)
- Focus on daily routines and common experiences
- Avoid contrived coincidences or melodramatic events
- Find conflict in realistic interpersonal dynamics

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Family dinner conversation reveals underlying tensions
- ❌ **Bad**: Convenient car accident brings estranged family together

**Film Reference**: Paterson (2016) - Entire film follows ordinary daily routine of bus driver.

---

### Requirement 4: Ambiguous Morality

**Description**: Characters should be morally complex, not clearly good or evil, reflecting real human moral ambiguity.

**Why It Matters**: Real people are complicated; clear heroes and villains feel artificial.

**Implementation**:
- Give protagonists flaws and poor choices
- Show antagonists' humanity and motivations
- Avoid moral absolutes
- Present ethical dilemmas without easy answers

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Protagonist makes selfish choice that hurts others but is understandable
- ❌ **Bad**: Pure hero fights pure villain in moral black-and-white

**Film Reference**: The Florida Project (2017) - Characters are flawed but sympathetic, not heroes or villains.

---

### Requirement 5: Unresolved Endings

**Description**: Conclusions should reflect life's ambiguity, avoiding neat resolutions or Hollywood endings.

**Why It Matters**: Real life rarely provides complete closure or perfect resolutions.

**Implementation**:
- Leave some questions unanswered
- Avoid tying up all loose ends
- Show ongoing struggles rather than complete transformation
- Embrace ambiguity and uncertainty

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character makes progress but future remains uncertain
- ❌ **Bad**: All problems solved, character completely transformed, perfect happy ending

**Film Reference**: Lady Bird (2017) - Ending shows growth but not complete resolution.

---

### Requirement 6: Observational Detail

**Description**: Include specific, authentic details that ground story in observable reality.

**Why It Matters**: Specific details create verisimilitude and authentic atmosphere.

**Implementation**:
- Research actual locations, professions, cultures
- Include mundane but authentic details
- Use specific rather than generic descriptions
- Show knowledge of depicted world

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Specific details of character's profession, neighborhood, daily routine
- ❌ **Bad**: Generic, vague descriptions that could apply anywhere

**Film Reference**: Moonlight (2016) - Specific details of Miami neighborhood create authentic world.

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Overall Rhythm

- Slower, more deliberate pacing reflecting real time
- Allow scenes to unfold naturally without rushing
- Include mundane moments between dramatic beats
- Avoid artificial acceleration for plot purposes

### Scene Length

- Scenes play out in near-real time (3-5 pages)
- Longer conversations without cutting away
- Include setup and aftermath, not just climactic moments
- Vary length based on natural scene rhythms

### Act Structure

- **Act I**: Establish character's ordinary world and relationships (30% of runtime)
- **Act II**: Develop conflicts through realistic complications (40% of runtime)
- **Act III**: Resolve some issues while leaving others open (30% of runtime)

### Transitions

- Simple cuts between scenes
- Minimal use of montages or time compression
- Natural progression from scene to scene
- Avoid flashy or stylized transitions

## Visual Storytelling

### Camera Work

- Handheld or steady-cam for documentary feel
- Natural lighting whenever possible
- Avoid showy camera movements
- Observational, unobtrusive cinematography

### Visual Motifs

- Authentic locations, not sets
- Natural color palettes
- Everyday objects and environments
- Minimal visual stylization

### Action Lines

- Specific, observed details
- Natural, unforced descriptions
- Focus on character behavior
- Avoid poetic or heightened language

**Example**:
```
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Sarah makes coffee. The machine sputters. She checks her phone while waiting, scrolls through messages without responding.
```

## Dialogue Approach

### Dialogue Style

- Conversational, natural speech patterns
- Incomplete sentences and interruptions
- Regional dialects and authentic vocabulary
- Subtext through what's not said

### Subtext

- Characters avoid direct emotional expression
- Meaning emerges from context and behavior
- Uncomfortable silences carry weight
- Real people rarely say exactly what they mean

### Formatting

- Standard formatting with natural rhythms
- Overlapping dialogue when appropriate
- Pauses and beats for realistic timing
- Minimal parentheticals

**Example**:
```
JOHN
So, uh... how've you been?

MARY
Fine. You?

JOHN
Yeah, good. Work's been--

MARY
That's good.

Awkward silence.
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Boring Authenticity

**Problem**: Realism becomes excuse for lack of dramatic structure or compelling narrative.

**Solution**: Find drama within authentic situations. Realistic doesn't mean plotless.

**Example**: Manchester by the Sea is realistic but maintains compelling dramatic tension.

---

### Pitfall 2: Improvised Aimlessness

**Problem**: Naturalistic dialogue becomes rambling and purposeless.

**Solution**: Even natural dialogue should serve character and story. Edit ruthlessly.

**Example**: Before Sunrise's dialogue feels natural but every conversation reveals character.

---

### Pitfall 3: Depressing Nihilism

**Problem**: Realism becomes excuse for relentlessly bleak, hopeless narratives.

**Solution**: Find authentic moments of joy, humor, and connection within realistic framework.

**Example**: The Florida Project finds beauty and joy in difficult circumstances.

---

### Pitfall 4: Lack of Specificity

**Problem**: Generic "realistic" details that don't create authentic world.

**Solution**: Research deeply and include specific cultural, geographic, and social details.

**Example**: Moonlight's specific Miami neighborhood details create authentic world.

---

### Pitfall 5: Forced Naturalism

**Problem**: Trying so hard to be realistic that it becomes affected and artificial.

**Solution**: Let naturalism emerge organically. Don't force it.

**Example**: Lady Bird's naturalism feels effortless, not forced.
