# Horror Genre

**Category**: Screenplay Genre  
**Type**: Primary  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Horror films evoke fear, dread, and terror through supernatural or psychological threats. The genre emphasizes atmosphere, suspense, and the violation of safety and normalcy to create visceral emotional responses in the audience.

## Core Concept

Horror screenplays exploit primal fears and anxieties, creating tension through the unknown, the uncanny, and the monstrous. Success depends on building atmosphere, controlling pacing, and delivering effective scares while maintaining believable character reactions. The best horror films tap into deeper psychological or societal fears beyond surface-level jump scares.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Establish Normalcy Before Breaking It

**Description**: Begin with a recognizable, safe world before introducing the horror element. The contrast amplifies the terror.

**Why It Matters**: Horror is most effective when it violates expectations of safety. Without establishing normalcy, there's nothing to lose.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Happy family moves into dream home, then discovers dark history
- ❌ **Bad**: Opening with chaos and horror without establishing what's at stake

**Film Reference**: The Shining (1980) - The Overlook Hotel appears beautiful and isolated before revealing its malevolence.

---

### Rule 2: Build Dread Through Anticipation

**Description**: The fear of what might happen is often more terrifying than what actually happens. Use suspense and delayed gratification.

**Why It Matters**: Constant scares create desensitization. Building dread through anticipation keeps audiences on edge.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Slow tracking shot down a dark hallway with ominous sounds
- ❌ **Bad**: Jump scare every 30 seconds with no buildup

**Film Reference**: Alien (1979) - The xenomorph is barely seen for most of the film, building unbearable tension.

---

### Rule 3: Make the Threat Relentless

**Description**: Once the horror is unleashed, it should be persistent and difficult to escape or defeat.

**Why It Matters**: Easy solutions deflate tension. The threat must feel overwhelming and inescapable.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Every attempt to escape or fight back fails or makes things worse
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters easily defeat the monster halfway through

**Film Reference**: It Follows (2014) - The entity never stops pursuing, creating constant dread.

---

### Rule 4: Isolate Your Characters

**Description**: Remove safety nets—no cell phones, no police, no easy escape routes.

**Why It Matters**: Isolation forces characters to confront the threat directly and prevents easy solutions.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Remote cabin, no signal, car won't start, storm blocks roads
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters in populated area with working phones and nearby help

**Film Reference**: The Thing (1982) - Antarctic research station, completely cut off from civilization.

---

### Rule 5: Violate Safe Spaces

**Description**: Turn familiar, safe locations (homes, schools, hospitals) into sites of terror.

**Why It Matters**: Violating safe spaces creates deeper psychological impact than obviously dangerous locations.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: The monster appears in the child's bedroom at night
- ❌ **Bad**: All scares happen in obviously creepy abandoned buildings

**Film Reference**: A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) - Sleep, the ultimate safe space, becomes deadly.

## Guidelines

### Structure

- **Act I**: Establish normalcy, introduce characters, hint at the threat, first disturbing incident
- **Act II**: Escalate encounters with the threat, failed escape attempts, revelations about the horror's nature, characters isolated
- **Act III**: Final confrontation, survival or defeat, resolution (often ambiguous)

### Pacing

- Start slow to build atmosphere and character investment
- Gradually increase frequency and intensity of scares
- Use quiet moments between scares to reset tension
- Build to climactic confrontation with maximum intensity
- Consider ambiguous or unsettling endings over neat resolutions

### Character Archetypes

- **Protagonist**: Often ordinary person thrust into extraordinary horror; "Final Girl" in slasher films
- **Antagonist**: Monster, ghost, killer, or supernatural force; often represents deeper fears
- **Supporting**: Skeptic who dies first, believer who's ignored, authority figure who's useless, comic relief who provides temporary levity

### Tone and Atmosphere

- Oppressive, claustrophobic, unsettling
- Use silence and ambient sound as effectively as music
- Darkness, shadows, and limited visibility
- Uncanny valley—things that are almost but not quite right
- Dread and unease over constant shock

### Visual Style

- Low-key lighting with deep shadows
- Handheld or steadicam for subjective POV
- Wide shots to show isolation; tight shots for claustrophobia
- Reveal threats gradually or keep them partially obscured
- Use of mirrors, reflections, and windows for scares

### Dialogue

- Minimal exposition; show don't tell
- Realistic reactions to fear (denial, panic, irrational decisions)
- Avoid characters explaining the obvious
- Use silence effectively
- Subtext of unspoken fears and tensions

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Over-Explaining the Monster

**Problem**: Providing too much backstory or logic for the horror element removes mystery and reduces fear.

**Solution**: Keep the threat partially unexplained. Mystery is scarier than complete understanding.

**Example**: The Blair Witch Project never shows the witch, maintaining ambiguity and terror.

---

### Pitfall 2: Stupid Character Decisions

**Problem**: Characters making obviously idiotic choices (splitting up, investigating strange noises alone) breaks immersion.

**Solution**: Give characters believable reasons for their actions, even if those actions lead to danger.

**Example**: In The Descent, characters make risky caving decisions based on established character traits and group dynamics.

---

### Pitfall 3: Jump Scares Without Substance

**Problem**: Relying solely on loud noises and sudden movements without building genuine dread.

**Solution**: Use jump scares sparingly as punctuation to sustained tension, not as the primary scare tactic.

**Example**: Hereditary uses shocking moments within a framework of sustained psychological dread.
