# Poetic Narrative Style

**Category**: Screenplay Narrative Style  
**Type**: Tonal  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Poetic narrative emphasizes lyrical language, visual metaphor, symbolic imagery, and rhythmic structure to create emotionally resonant, aesthetically beautiful storytelling. This style prioritizes mood, atmosphere, and sensory experience over conventional plot mechanics.

## Core Concept

Poetic screenwriting treats film as visual poetry, using imagery, symbolism, and rhythm to evoke emotion and meaning beyond literal narrative. The power lies in creating transcendent moments where form and content merge, where images and sounds create meaning that dialogue cannot express. Success requires visual imagination, literary sensibility, and trust in cinema's capacity for non-verbal communication.

## Definition

A poetic narrative uses lyrical language, visual metaphor, symbolic imagery, and rhythmic pacing to create meaning through aesthetic beauty and emotional resonance rather than conventional dramatic structure.

## Structural Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lyrical Action Lines

**Description**: Action descriptions should be written with poetic language, rhythm, and imagery.

**Why It Matters**: Poetic style must extend to the screenplay's prose, not just the finished film.

**Implementation**:
- Use metaphor and simile in descriptions
- Create rhythm through sentence structure
- Employ sensory details and imagery
- Write with literary beauty

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: "Rain falls like tears from a grieving sky. She walks through it, becoming one with the sorrow."
- ❌ **Bad**: "It's raining. She walks down the street."

**Film Reference**: The Tree of Life (2011) - Screenplay uses poetic language throughout.

---

### Requirement 2: Visual Metaphor

**Description**: Use images and visual sequences to convey meaning metaphorically rather than literally.

**Why It Matters**: Poetic cinema communicates through symbol and metaphor, not just plot.

**Implementation**:
- Create visual symbols that represent themes
- Use nature imagery metaphorically
- Juxtapose images for meaning
- Trust visual storytelling over exposition

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Dying tree represents character's fading hope
- ❌ **Bad**: Character explains their feelings through dialogue

**Film Reference**: The Fountain (2006) - Tree of life as central visual metaphor.

---

### Requirement 3: Rhythmic Structure

**Description**: Create rhythm through scene length, pacing, and repetition of visual motifs.

**Why It Matters**: Poetry depends on rhythm; poetic film should have musical structure.

**Implementation**:
- Vary scene length for rhythmic effect
- Repeat visual motifs like refrains
- Create patterns and variations
- Use montage for rhythmic sequences

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Series of dawn scenes showing passage of time with variations
- ❌ **Bad**: Random scene lengths with no rhythmic pattern

**Film Reference**: Koyaanisqatsi (1982) - Pure visual rhythm without dialogue.

---

### Requirement 4: Symbolic Imagery

**Description**: Objects, colors, and images should carry symbolic weight beyond literal meaning.

**Why It Matters**: Poetic narrative operates on symbolic level, creating layers of meaning.

**Implementation**:
- Assign symbolic meaning to recurring objects
- Use color symbolically
- Create visual leitmotifs
- Layer multiple meanings in single image

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Red balloon represents lost innocence, appearing throughout film
- ❌ **Bad**: Objects used only for literal plot purposes

**Film Reference**: Hero (2002) - Colors represent different emotional/philosophical states.

---

### Requirement 5: Minimal Dialogue

**Description**: Reduce dialogue to essential moments, letting images and sounds carry narrative.

**Why It Matters**: Poetic cinema prioritizes visual and aural poetry over verbal.

**Implementation**:
- Use dialogue sparingly and purposefully
- Make dialogue itself poetic when used
- Rely on visual storytelling
- Embrace silence and ambient sound

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Character's emotional state shown through imagery, not explained
- ❌ **Bad**: Characters explain themes and emotions through dialogue

**Film Reference**: The Revenant (2015) - Minimal dialogue, maximum visual poetry.

---

### Requirement 6: Transcendent Moments

**Description**: Include sequences that transcend literal narrative to create pure aesthetic/emotional experience.

**Why It Matters**: Poetic cinema aims for moments of beauty and transcendence.

**Implementation**:
- Create sequences focused on beauty over plot
- Allow time for contemplation
- Use music and imagery for emotional impact
- Trust audiences to experience rather than understand

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Extended sequence of natural beauty that evokes emotion
- ❌ **Bad**: Every scene serves only plot function

**Film Reference**: Baraka (1992) - Entire film is transcendent visual poetry.

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Overall Rhythm

- Slow, contemplative pacing allowing absorption
- Rhythmic variation like musical composition
- Extended sequences for aesthetic experience
- Breathing room between dramatic moments

### Scene Length

- Highly varied for rhythmic effect
- Some very short (single image)
- Some extended (5-10 minutes)
- Length serves aesthetic purpose

### Act Structure

- **Act I**: Establish visual language and symbolic vocabulary (30% of runtime)
- **Act II**: Develop themes through visual variations (40% of runtime)
- **Act III**: Bring visual/thematic elements to resolution (30% of runtime)

### Transitions

- Dissolves and fades for dreamlike quality
- Match cuts on visual metaphors
- Rhythmic cutting for montages
- Poetic juxtapositions

## Visual Storytelling

### Camera Work

- Beautiful, composed cinematography
- Slow, graceful camera movements
- Emphasis on natural beauty
- Painterly compositions

### Visual Motifs

- Recurring symbols and images
- Nature imagery (water, fire, earth, air)
- Light and shadow symbolism
- Color as emotional/thematic indicator

### Action Lines

- Lyrical, poetic prose
- Metaphorical descriptions
- Sensory details
- Literary beauty

**Example**:
```
EXT. FIELD - GOLDEN HOUR

Wheat sways like an ocean of gold. She moves through it, a ship on a sea of grain. The setting sun paints her in amber light.

She stops. Closes her eyes. Becomes still as the earth itself.
```

## Dialogue Approach

### Dialogue Style

- Sparse and purposeful
- Poetic when used
- Metaphorical rather than literal
- Musical quality to speech

### Subtext

- Everything important is visual/symbolic
- Dialogue hints rather than states
- Silence carries meaning
- Subtext is primary text

### Formatting

- Long silences between lines
- Dialogue as rare punctuation

**Example**:
```
She looks at the horizon.

WOMAN
The light is dying.

MAN
It always does.

WOMAN
And always returns.

Silence. They watch the sunset together.
```
