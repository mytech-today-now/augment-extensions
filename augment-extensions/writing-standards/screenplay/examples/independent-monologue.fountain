INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

A cramped studio apartment. Peeling wallpaper. A single window overlooks a fire escape. SARAH (32), disheveled, sits on the edge of a worn couch, staring at a photograph in her hands.

The room is silent except for the distant hum of traffic.

She sets the photo down gently on the coffee table - it shows a younger version of herself with a man, both smiling.

SARAH
(quietly, to herself)
You know what the hardest part is?

She stands, walks to the window. Her reflection stares back at her.

SARAH (CONT'D)
It's not the big moments. Not the funeral, not the condolences, not even the empty side of the bed.

She touches the glass, her fingers leaving prints.

SARAH (CONT'D)
It's the small things. The way you'd leave your coffee cup on the counter, half-finished. How you'd hum that stupid song in the shower - what was it? Something from the eighties.

A bitter laugh escapes her.

SARAH (CONT'D)
I used to hate that. The humming. The half-finished coffee. The way you'd leave your shoes right in the middle of the hallway where I'd trip over them every single morning.

She turns away from the window, her voice breaking.

SARAH (CONT'D)
And now... now I'd give anything to trip over those shoes one more time. To hear that off-key humming. To pour out that cold coffee and complain about the waste.

She sinks back onto the couch, picking up the photograph again.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Everyone keeps telling me it gets easier. That time heals. But they don't understand - I don't want it to get easier. Because easier means forgetting. And forgetting means losing you all over again.

Tears stream down her face now.

SARAH (CONT'D)
So I keep your coffee cup on the counter. I play that eighties song every morning. I leave your shoes in the hallway.

She clutches the photograph to her chest.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Because if I can't have you here... at least I can keep you close. Even if it hurts. Especially because it hurts.

She closes her eyes, rocking slightly.

SARAH (CONT'D)
(whispered)
I'm not ready to let go. I don't know if I ever will be.

The room falls silent again. Sarah sits motionless, the photograph pressed against her heart.

FADE OUT.
