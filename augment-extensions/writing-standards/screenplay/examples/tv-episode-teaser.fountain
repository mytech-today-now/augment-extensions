TEASER

FADE IN:

EXT. ROCKY COASTLINE - NIGHT

Waves crash against jagged rocks. A lighthouse beam cuts through thick fog, rotating slowly.

SUPER: "DARK HARBOR, MAINE - 11:47 PM"

INT. LIGHTHOUSE - KEEPER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

THOMAS BRENNAN (58), weathered face, flannel shirt, sits at a small desk writing in a logbook. The lighthouse beam sweeps past the window every few seconds, illuminating the room in rhythmic flashes.

A RADIO CRACKLES on the desk.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
(through radio)
Lighthouse Station Seven, this is Harbor Patrol. Do you copy?

Thomas picks up the radio.

THOMAS
This is Station Seven. Go ahead, Harbor Patrol.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
We're getting reports of a vessel in distress approximately two miles northeast of your position. Can you confirm visual?

Thomas stands, walks to the window, peers out into the fog.

THOMAS
Negative, Harbor Patrol. Visibility is near zero. I can barely see past the rocks.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Copy that. Keep your eyes open. Coast Guard is en route but they're twenty minutes out.

THOMAS
Will do.

He sets down the radio, returns to the window. The beam sweeps across the fog.

Then - a FLASH OF LIGHT in the distance. Not the lighthouse beam. Something else.

Thomas grabs binoculars, scans the water.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
(into radio)
Harbor Patrol, I've got something. Looks like... wait.

Through the binoculars: A SMALL BOAT, adrift. No lights. No movement.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
I've got visual on a vessel. Appears to be a fishing boat, maybe twenty-footer. Dead in the water.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Any signs of crew?

Thomas adjusts the binoculars. Squints.

THOMAS
Can't tell from here. I'm going to take the launch out for a closer look.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Negative, Station Seven. Wait for Coast Guard.

THOMAS
They're twenty minutes out. If someone's in the water, they don't have twenty minutes.

He's already moving, grabbing a jacket and flashlight.

EXT. LIGHTHOUSE DOCK - NIGHT

Thomas climbs into a small motorboat, starts the engine. It ROARS to life.

He steers into the fog, the lighthouse beam fading behind him.

EXT. OPEN WATER - NIGHT

The motorboat cuts through choppy waves. Thomas keeps his flashlight trained ahead.

The abandoned fishing boat comes into view, rocking with the waves.

THOMAS
(into handheld radio)
Harbor Patrol, I'm approaching the vessel now.

He pulls alongside. The boat is eerily quiet. No name visible on the hull.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
Boat appears abandoned. No visible damage. I'm going aboard.

He ties off and climbs onto the fishing boat.

INT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Thomas sweeps his flashlight across the deck. Fishing nets are neatly coiled. Equipment is stowed properly. Everything is in order.

Too much in order.

He moves to the cabin door, opens it slowly.

INT. FISHING BOAT - CABIN - NIGHT

The flashlight beam reveals a small cabin. Navigation equipment. A half-eaten sandwich on the console. A coffee cup, still steaming.

Thomas touches the cup. Warm.

THOMAS
(into radio)
Harbor Patrol, this is strange. The boat looks like it was just abandoned. There's fresh coffee, food...

He notices something on the navigation screen. Leans closer.

The GPS shows a route - but it's not heading to shore. It's heading out to sea. To a specific coordinate.

Thomas pulls out his phone, takes a photo of the screen.

Then he sees it: A LOGBOOK on the seat, open to today's date.

He picks it up, reads the last entry. His face goes pale.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
(whispered)
Oh my God.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Station Seven, say again?

Thomas doesn't respond. He's staring at the logbook entry.

We see it over his shoulder:

"THEY FOUND ME. IF YOU'RE READING THIS, DON'T GO TO THE COORDINATES. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T—"

The entry ends mid-sentence.

Suddenly - the boat's radio CRACKLES to life.

VOICE (V.O.)
(distorted, barely audible)
...Thomas... can you hear me...

Thomas spins around, staring at the radio.

THOMAS
Who is this?

VOICE (V.O.)
...you shouldn't have come... turn back... while you still can...

THOMAS
Identify yourself!

The radio goes dead. Silence.

Then - a SPLASH outside. Something hitting the water.

Thomas rushes to the deck.

EXT. FISHING BOAT - DECK - NIGHT

He sweeps his flashlight across the water. Nothing but fog and waves.

Then he sees it: His motorboat. The rope is cut. It's drifting away.

THOMAS
No, no, no!

He runs to the edge, but the boat is already too far.

Behind him - FOOTSTEPS on the deck.

Thomas spins around, flashlight raised.

Nothing there.

But the cabin door is now closed. He left it open.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
(into radio, urgent)
Harbor Patrol, I need immediate assistance. My boat is gone and there's someone—

The radio DIES. Screen goes black.

Thomas is alone in the fog. On a dead boat. With something - or someone - in the cabin.

He backs toward the railing, flashlight shaking in his hand.

The cabin door slowly creaks open.

SMASH TO BLACK.
