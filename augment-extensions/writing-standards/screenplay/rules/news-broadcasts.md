# News Broadcasts

## Overview

News broadcast scripts require factual accuracy, clear communication, precise timing, and adherence to journalistic ethics. Scripts must be written for teleprompter delivery while maintaining conversational tone and credibility.

## Core Principles

### SPJ Code of Ethics
**Seek Truth and Report It**:
- Verify information before publication
- Identify sources clearly
- Provide context
- Avoid stereotyping
- Support the open exchange of views

**Minimize Harm**:
- Balance public's need to know with potential harm
- Show compassion for those affected by news
- Recognize that private people have greater right to privacy
- Be cautious about identifying juveniles

**Act Independently**:
- Avoid conflicts of interest
- Refuse gifts and favors
- Deny favored treatment to advertisers/donors
- Resist internal and external pressure

**Be Accountable and Transparent**:
- Explain ethical choices to audiences
- Respond quickly to questions
- Acknowledge mistakes and correct them
- Expose unethical conduct in journalism

## Script Format

### Anchor Script
**Format**:
```

### Timing Marks
**Notation**:
- **(0:00)** - Start time
- **(0:15)** - 15-second mark
- **(0:30)** - 30-second mark
- **(TOTAL: 1:45)** - Total runtime

### Teleprompter Formatting
**Guidelines**:
- ALL CAPS for anchor names
- Mixed case for script text
- Double-space between paragraphs
- Clear pronunciation guides
- Timing marks in margins
- Camera cues in parentheses

## Story Structure

### Hard News Story
**Structure** (30-90 seconds):
1. **Lead** (5-10 seconds): Most important information
2. **Body** (15-60 seconds): Supporting details, context
3. **Close** (5-10 seconds): Future implications, wrap-up

**Example**:
```
LEAD:
A major fire destroyed a downtown warehouse
early this morning, displacing 50 workers.

BODY:
Firefighters responded to the blaze at
3 AM. No injuries were reported, but the
building is a total loss. The cause remains
under investigation.

CLOSE:
The company says it will relocate operations
to a temporary facility while rebuilding.
```

### Feature Story
**Structure** (1:30-3:00):
1. **Hook** (10-15 seconds): Engaging opening
2. **Nut Graf** (10-15 seconds): Why it matters
3. **Development** (45-120 seconds): Details, interviews
4. **Kicker** (10-15 seconds): Memorable ending

## Writing Style

### Conversational Tone
**Guidelines**:
- Write for the ear, not the eye
- Use contractions
- Active voice
- Short sentences
- Simple words

**Bad**:
```

convened to deliberate upon the proposed
infrastructure improvements.
```

**Good**:
```

plans for new roads and bridges.
```

### Clarity and Precision
**Rules**:
- One idea per sentence
- Subject-verb-object order
- Avoid jargon
- Define technical terms
- Use specific numbers
- Attribute information

### Present Tense
**Usage**:
- Use present tense when possible
- Creates immediacy
- Sounds more current
- Engages viewers

**Example**:
```
BAD: The mayor said yesterday...
GOOD: The mayor says...
```
