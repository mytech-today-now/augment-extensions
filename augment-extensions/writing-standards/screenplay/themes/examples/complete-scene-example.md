## The Scene

### INT. MARCUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

*The city glows through floor-to-ceiling windows. SARAH stands at the door, holding a folder. MARCUS sits at his desk, reviewing documents.*

**MARCUS**  
Sarah. Working late again?

*Sarah enters, closes the door. The CLICK echoes.*

**SARAH**  
I found something in the Q3 reports.

*Marcus doesn't look up. A beat.*

**MARCUS**  
Did you.

**SARAH**  
Offshore accounts. Transfers that don't match the ledger.

*Marcus sets down his pen. Slowly looks up.*

**MARCUS**  
(calmly)  
Close the blinds.

*Sarah hesitates. Then crosses to the windows. As she closes each blind, the office darkens. VISUAL MOTIF: Isolation, secrecy.*

**MARCUS**  
How much did you find?

**SARAH**  
Enough to know it's not a mistake.

*Marcus stands, moves to the bar cart. Pours two scotches.*

**MARCUS**  
You know what I see when I look at you? Myself. Twenty years ago. Hungry. Smart. Willing to do what it takes.

*He offers her a glass. She doesn't take it.*

**SARAH**  
This isn't about ambition. It's theft.

**MARCUS**  
(laughs)  
Theft? I built this company. Turned it from a regional nobody into a Fortune 500. And what did I get? A salary. Stock options that vest when I'm too old to enjoy them.

*He drinks both scotches.*

**MARCUS** (CONT'D)  
I took what I earned. What they were too cheap to pay me.

**SARAH**  
You took from the pension fund. From people who trusted you.

**MARCUS**  
And you're going to report me?

*Silence. Sarah's hand tightens on the folder.*

**MARCUS** (CONT'D)  
Think carefully. You report me, you destroy your career. Who do you think recommended you for VP? Who's been grooming you?

*He moves closer. Predatory.*

**MARCUS** (CONT'D)  
You turn me in, you're the whistleblower. The snitch. You'll never work in this industry again.

**SARAH**  
(quietly)  
I know.

**MARCUS**  
Or... you put that folder in the shredder. Tomorrow, I announce you as my successor. CFO track. Everything you've worked for.

*Sarah looks at the folder. Then at Marcus.*

**SARAH**  
You taught me that integrity matters.

**MARCUS**  
I taught you that winning matters.

**SARAH**  
No. You taught me what happens when ambition becomes corruption.

*She turns toward the door.*

**MARCUS**  
Sarah. Don't do this.

*She stops. Doesn't turn.*

**SARAH**  
I'm sorry, Marcus. I really am.

*She opens the door. Light floods in from the hallway.*

**MARCUS**  
You're throwing away everything!

**SARAH**  
(turning back)  
No. I'm keeping the only thing that matters.

*She leaves. Marcus stands alone in the darkened office, surrounded by symbols of power that suddenly feel empty.*

**FADE OUT.**

## Writing Techniques Demonstrated

### Subtext in Dialogue

**Surface Level**: Conversation about financial irregularities  
**Subtext Level**: Battle for Sarah's soul, mentor's corruption revealed

**Examples**:
- "Close the blinds" - Not about privacy, about hiding truth
- "How much did you find?" - Not curiosity, threat assessment
- "I see myself in you" - Claiming ownership, manipulation

### Visual Storytelling

**Light/Dark Motif**:
- Bright office → Closing blinds → Darkness → Light from hallway
- Represents: Truth → Secrecy → Corruption → Redemption

**Spatial Dynamics**:
- Marcus behind desk (power position)
- Sarah at door (escape route, choice)
- Marcus approaching (intimidation)
- Sarah leaving into light (moral choice)

### Character Behavior

**Marcus**:
- Calm initially (confidence in power)
- Offers drink (attempting complicity)
- Moves closer (physical intimidation)
- Desperate at end (power failing)

**Sarah**:
- Hesitant (internal conflict)
- Doesn't take drink (refusing complicity)
- Quiet resolve (moral strength)
- Leaves (active choice)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **Mistake 1: On-the-Nose Dialogue**

**Bad Version**:
```
SARAH
Your ambition has corrupted you! You've betrayed 
everyone who trusted you! Power has isolated you!
```

**Why It Fails**: States themes explicitly instead of showing them

**Good Version** (from scene):
```
SARAH
You taught me what happens when ambition becomes corruption.
```

**Why It Works**: Implies theme through character observation

### ❌ **Mistake 2: No Visual Storytelling**

**Bad Version**: Scene in generic office with no visual elements supporting theme

**Good Version** (from scene): Closing blinds = increasing darkness = moral corruption

### ❌ **Mistake 3: Easy Choice**

**Bad Version**: Sarah immediately reports Marcus without hesitation

**Why It Fails**: No dramatic tension, sacrifice feels cheap

**Good Version** (from scene): Sarah hesitates, acknowledges cost, makes difficult choice

### ❌ **Mistake 4: Villain Without Justification**

**Bad Version**: Marcus is purely evil with no explanation

**Why It Fails**: One-dimensional, unrealistic

**Good Version** (from scene): Marcus explains his reasoning, making him human despite being wrong
