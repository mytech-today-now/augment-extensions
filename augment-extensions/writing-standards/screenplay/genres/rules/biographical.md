# Biographical Genre

**Category**: Screenplay Genre  
**Type**: Primary  
**Complexity**: High

## Overview

Biographical films (biopics) dramatize the lives of real people, focusing on significant periods, achievements, or struggles. The genre emphasizes character transformation, historical context, and finding universal themes in individual lives.

## Core Concept

Biographical screenplays transform real lives into compelling drama by selecting specific periods or themes rather than attempting comprehensive life stories. Success depends on finding the dramatic arc within a real life, balancing factual accuracy with narrative structure, and revealing universal human truths through specific individual experiences. Great biopics make audiences care about the person, not just their achievements.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Find the Dramatic Arc

**Description**: Don't try to tell an entire life. Focus on a specific period, conflict, or transformation that has clear dramatic structure.

**Why It Matters**: Lives don't naturally follow three-act structure. You must find or create the arc.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Focus on specific period (Lincoln's final months, Jobs creating iPod)
- ❌ **Bad**: Birth-to-death chronology with no clear dramatic focus

**Film Reference**: The Social Network (2010) - Focuses on Facebook's founding, not Zuckerberg's entire life.

---

### Rule 2: Show the Person, Not the Icon

**Description**: Humanize the subject. Show flaws, contradictions, and private moments, not just public achievements.

**Why It Matters**: Icons are distant; humans are relatable. Complexity creates compelling drama.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Subject shown with flaws, failures, and personal struggles
- ❌ **Bad**: Hagiography that worships subject without complexity

**Film Reference**: Raging Bull (1980) - Jake LaMotta shown as brilliant boxer and deeply flawed human.

---

### Rule 3: Use Supporting Characters Actively

**Description**: People around the subject should be fully realized characters with their own arcs, not just witnesses to greatness.

**Why It Matters**: Supporting characters provide perspective, conflict, and emotional depth.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Family, rivals, and colleagues with their own motivations and development
- ❌ **Bad**: Cardboard cutouts who exist only to react to protagonist

**Film Reference**: The Theory of Everything (2014) - Jane Hawking's perspective and arc as important as Stephen's.

---

### Rule 4: Thematic Truth Over Literal Truth

**Description**: Capture the essence and meaning of the person's life, even if specific details are compressed or dramatized.

**Why It Matters**: Dramatic truth serves the story; literal accuracy can be dramatically inert.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Composite characters or compressed timeline that serves emotional truth
- ❌ **Bad**: Inventing major events that contradict known facts or character

**Film Reference**: Amadeus (1984) - Historically inaccurate but captures truth about genius and envy.

---

### Rule 5: Make It Universal

**Description**: The specific life should illuminate universal human experiences - ambition, love, failure, redemption.

**Why It Matters**: Audiences connect through shared humanity, not just admiration for achievements.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: Specific story that resonates with universal themes
- ❌ **Bad**: "Greatest hits" of achievements with no emotional core

**Film Reference**: Milk (2008) - Harvey Milk's specific struggle illuminates universal fight for equality.

## Guidelines

### Structure

- **Act I**: Introduce subject in their world, establish what they want or what drives them, inciting incident that launches main conflict
- **Act II**: Pursuit of goal, obstacles and setbacks, relationships tested, character transformation begins
- **Act III**: Climax of main conflict, resolution (triumph, tragedy, or both), epilogue showing legacy or outcome

### Pacing

- Start in medias res or at crucial moment, not necessarily birth
- Use flashbacks sparingly and purposefully
- Montages for passage of time or achievements
- Focus on key moments that reveal character
- Epilogue can provide historical context or outcome

### Character Archetypes

- **Protagonist**: The biographical subject with clear wants and flaws
- **Antagonist**: Rival, system, or internal demons opposing protagonist
- **Supporting**: Family, mentors, collaborators, witnesses - all fully realized

### Tone and Atmosphere

- Varies by subject (inspirational, tragic, complex)
- Intimate even when depicting public figures
- Emotional authenticity over reverence
- Can be celebratory or critical
- Often reflective on legacy and meaning

### Visual Style

- Period-appropriate production design
- Visual motifs reflecting subject's work or life
- Intimate cinematography for personal moments
- Can use stylistic choices to reflect subject's art or perspective
- Archival footage or photos in epilogue

### Dialogue

- Research subject's actual speech patterns and vocabulary
- Balance authenticity with accessibility
- Key quotes from real life can be powerful
- Avoid over-explaining achievements - show don't tell
- Subtext in personal relationships

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Cradle-to-Grave Structure

**Problem**: Trying to cover entire life results in superficial greatest-hits montage.

**Solution**: Focus on specific period or theme with clear dramatic arc.

**Example**: Steve Jobs (2015) - Three product launches, not entire life.

---

### Pitfall 2: Hagiography

**Problem**: Worshipful portrayal that ignores flaws or complexity.

**Solution**: Show subject as fully human - flawed, contradictory, complex.

**Example**: Walk the Line (2005) - Johnny Cash's addiction and failures alongside his talent.

---

### Pitfall 3: Explaining Instead of Showing

**Problem**: Characters explaining subject's importance or achievements instead of dramatizing them.

**Solution**: Show the work, the struggle, the impact through action and consequence.

**Example**: Whiplash (2014) - Shows the brutal pursuit of musical excellence, doesn't explain it.
